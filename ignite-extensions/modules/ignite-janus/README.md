# Apache Ignite Storage Backend for JanusGraph
*JanusGraph* is a scalable graph database optimized for storing and querying graphs containing hundreds of billions of vertices and edges distributed across a multi-machine cluster. JanusGraph is a transactional database that can support thousands of concurrent users executing complex graph traversals in real time. More on [janusgraph.org](https:/janusgraph.org)

*Apache Ignite* is an in-memory computing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale. More on [ignite.apache.org](https://ignite.apache.org)

This project transforms JanusGraph into a distributed in-memory graph database at petabyte scale.

The current version is 0.5.3 and is compliant with JanusGraph 0.5.3.
