Apache Ignite In-Memory Data Fabric 1.0 RC3
-------------------------------------------

This is the first release of Apache Ignite project. The source code in large part is based
on the 7 year old GridGain In-Memory Data Fabric, open source edition, v. 6.6.2, which was
donated to Apache Software Foundation in September 2014.

The main feature set of Ignite In-Memory Data Fabric includes:
* Advanced Clustering
* Compute Grid
* Data Grid
* Service Grid
* IGFS - Ignite File System
* Distributed Data Structures
* Distributed Messaging
* Distributed Events
* Streaming & CEP
