/**
 * Shows the world's shortest MapReduce application that calculates non-space
 * length of the input string. This example works equally on one computer or
 * on thousands requiring no special configuration or deployment.
 * <p/>
 * Remote nodes should always be started with special configuration file which
 * enables P2P class loading: `'ignite.{sh|bat} examples/config/example-ignite.xml'`.
 * <p/>
 * Alternatively you can run `ExampleNodeStartup` in another JVM which will
 * start node with `examples/config/example-ignite.xml` configuration.
