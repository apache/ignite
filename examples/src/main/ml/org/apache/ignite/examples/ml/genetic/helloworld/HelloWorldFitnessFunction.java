/**
 * This example demonstrates how to create a IFitnessFunction
 *
 * Your IFitness function will vary depending on your particular use case.
 *
 * For this fitness function, we simply want to calculate the value of
 *
 * an individual solution relative to other solutions.
 *
 *
 * To do this, we simply increase fitness score by '1' for each character
 *
 * that is correct position.
 *
 * For our solution, our genetic algorithm will continue until
 *
 * we achieve a fitness score of '11', as 'HELLO WORLD' contains '11' characters.
