Apache Ignite Examples
======================

This folder contains code examples for various Apache Ignite functionality.

Examples are shipped as a separate Maven project, so to start running you simply need
to import provided `pom.xml` file into your favourite IDE.

The examples folder contains he following subfolders:

- `config` - contains Ignite configuration files needed for examples.
- `memcached` - contains PHP script demonstrating how Ignite Cache can be accessed using Memcached client.
- `rest` - contains PHP script demonstrating how Ignite Cache can be accessed via HTTP API.
- `src/main/java` - contains Java examples for different Ignite modules and features.
- `src/main/java8` - contains additional set of Java examples utilizing Java 8 lambdas. These examples
  are excluded by default, enable `java8` Maven profile to include them (JDK8 is required).
- `src/main/scala` - contains examples demonstrating usage of API provided by Scalar.
- `src/main/java-lgpl` - contains lgpl-based examples for different Ignite modules and features.
- `src/main/ml` - contains Java examples for Ignite-ML module.

Starting Remote Nodes
=====================

Remote nodes for examples should always be started with special configuration file which enables P2P
class loading: `examples/config/example-ignite.xml`. To run a remote node in IDE use `ExampleNodeStartup` class.


Java7 vs Java8
===============
Some examples (not all) which can benefit from Java8 Lambda support were re-written with Java8 lambdas.
For full set of examples, look at both Java7 and Java8 packages.


LGPL
=====
LGPL examples can be activated by turning lgpl profile on.

lgpl profile required some lgpl-based libs, for example: ignite-hibernate & ignite-schedule.
In case these libs can not be found by this maven project please download Apache Ignite sources
at https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi#sources.

There are some ways to gain required libs from sources:

1) Run "mvn clean install -DskipTests -P lgpl" at Apache Ignite sources.
This case will install lgpl-based libs to local maven repository.

2) Run "mvn clean package -DskipTests -Prelease,lgpl -Dignite.edition=lgpl" at Apache Ignite sources.
Required libs will appear at /target/release-package/libs/optional subfolders.
Found libs should be copied to global or project's classpath.

ML
==
Math/Machine Learning examples can be activated by turning ml profile on.

This module also required java8 and ignite-ml module.

Like the lgpl examples we could build required module running "mvn clean install -Pml -DskipTests -pl modules/ml -am".
