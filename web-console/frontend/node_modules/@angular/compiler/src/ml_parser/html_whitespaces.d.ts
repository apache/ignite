 * Angular Dart introduced &ngsp; as a placeholder for non-removable space, see:

 * In Angular Dart &ngsp; is converted to the 0xE500 PUA (Private Use Areas) unicode character
 * and later on replaced by a space. We are re-implementing the same idea here.

 * This visitor can walk HTML parse tree and remove / trim text nodes using the following rules:
 * - consider spaces, tabs and new lines as whitespace characters;
 * - drop text nodes consisting of whitespace characters only;
 * - for all other text nodes replace consecutive whitespace characters with one space;
 * - convert &ngsp; pseudo-entity to a single space;
 *
 * Removal and trimming of whitespaces have positive performance impact (less code to generate
 * while compiling templates, faster view creation). At the same time it can be "destructive"
 * in some cases (whitespaces can influence layout). Because of the potential of breaking layout
 * this visitor is not activated by default in Angular 5 and people need to explicitly opt-in for
 * whitespace removal. The default option for whitespace removal will be revisited in Angular 6
 * and might be changed to "on" by default.
