    /// API for cache persistent storage for read-through and write-through behavior.
    ///
    /// Persistent store is configured in Ignite's Spring XML configuration file via
    /// <c>CacheConfiguration.setStore()</c> property. If you have an implementation
    /// of cache store in .NET, you should use special Java wrapper which accepts assembly name and
    /// class name of .NET store implementation (both properties are mandatory).
    /// 
    /// Optionally, you may specify "properies" property to set any property values on an instance of your store.
    /// <example>
    /// Here is an example:
    /// <code>
    /// &lt;bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration">
    ///     ...
    ///     &lt;property name="cacheStoreFactory">
    ///         &lt;bean class="org.apache.ignite.platform.dotnet.PlatformDotNetCacheStoreFactory">
    ///             &lt;property name="assemblyName" value="MyAssembly"/>
    ///             &lt;property name="className" value="MyApp.MyCacheStore"/>
    ///             &lt;property name="properties">
    ///                 &lt;map>
    ///                     &lt;entry key="IntProperty">
    ///                         &lt;value type="java.lang.Integer">42&lt;/value>
    ///                     &lt;/entry>
    ///                     &lt;entry key="StringProperty" value="String value"/>
    ///                 &lt;/map>
    ///             &lt;/property>
