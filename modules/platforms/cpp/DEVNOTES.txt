Apache Ignite C++ Build Instructions
====================================
Here you can find instruction on how to build Apache Ignite C++ core library and
stand-alone node binary. To build examples you need to build and install core Apache
Ignite library then refer to $IGNITE_HOME/platforms/cpp/example/README.txt for 
futher instructions.

Building on Linux With Autotools
----------------------------------

Common Requirements:

 * GCC, g++, autotools, automake, and libtool must be installed
 * Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed: https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp
 * JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set pointing to Java installation directory.
 * IGNITE_HOME environment variable must be set to Ignite installation directory.

Building the Apache Ignite C++ components:

 * Build Apache Ignite C++ helper "common" library:
     * Navigate to the directory $IGNITE_HOME/platforms/cpp/common
     * Execute the following commands one by one:
         * libtoolize
         * aclocal
         * autoheader
         * automake --add-missing
         * autoreconf
         * ./configure
         * make
         * make install
 * Build Apache Ignite C++ "binary" library:
     * Navigate to the directory $IGNITE_HOME/platforms/cpp/binary
     * Execute the following commands one by one:
         * libtoolize
         * aclocal
         * autoheader
         * automake --add-missing
         * autoreconf
         * ./configure
         * make
         * make install
 * Build Apache Ignite C++ library:
     * Navigate to the directory $IGNITE_HOME/platforms/cpp/core
     * Execute the following commands one by one:
         * libtoolize
         * aclocal
         * autoheader
         * automake --add-missing
         * autoreconf
         * ./configure
         * make
         * make install
 * Build Apache Ignite C++ stand-alone node binary:
     * Navigate to the directory $IGNITE_HOME/platforms/cpp/ignite
     * Execute the following commands one by one:
         * libtoolize
         * aclocal
         * autoheader
         * automake --add-missing
         * autoreconf
         * ./configure
         * make
 * Build Apache Ignite ODBC driver:
     * Navigate to the directory $IGNITE_HOME/platforms/cpp/odbc
     * Execute the following commands one by one:
         * libtoolize
         * aclocal
         * autoheader
         * automake --add-missing
         * autoreconf
         * ./configure
         * make
         * make install

NOTE: "make install" command may require superuser privileges. In this case it must be
executed as "sudo make install".

Building on Windows with Visual Studio (tm)
----------------------------------

Common Requirements:

 * Microsoft Visual Studio (tm) 2010 or later
 * Windows SDK 7.1
 * Java Development Kit (JDK) must be installed: https://java.com/en/download/index.jsp
 * JAVA_HOME environment variable must be set pointing to Java installation directory.
 * IGNITE_HOME environment variable must be set to Ignite installation directory.

Building binaries:

 * Open and build %IGNITE_HOME%\platforms\cpp\project\vs\ignite.sln (or ignite_86.sln if
   you are running 32-bit platform).

Building in later versions of Visual Studio:
 * Open project\vs\ignite.sln or project\vs\ignite_86.sln in Visual Studio
 * You will be prompted to "Update VC++ Compiler and Libraries", click "Update"
 * Build the solution.
