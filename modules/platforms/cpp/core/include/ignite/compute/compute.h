         * Defines compute grid functionality for executing tasks and closures
         * over nodes in the ClusterGroup. Instance of Compute is obtained from
         * Ignite as follows:
         * @code{.cpp}
         * Ignite node = Ignition::Get();
         *
         * // Compute over all nodes in the cluster.
         * Compute c = node.GetCompute();
         * @endcode
         *
         * @par Load Balancing
         * In all cases other than <tt>Broadcast(...)</tt>, Ignite must select
         * a node for a computation to be executed. The node will be selected
         * based on the underlying \c LoadBalancingSpi, which by default
         * sequentially picks next available node from the underlying cluster
         * group. Other load balancing policies, such as \c random or
         * \c adaptive, can be configured as well by selecting a different
         * load balancing SPI in Ignite configuration.
         *
         * @par Fault Tolerance
         * Ignite guarantees that as long as there is at least one grid node
         * standing, every job will be executed. Jobs will automatically
         * failover to another node if a remote node crashed or has rejected
         * execution due to lack of resources. By default, in case of failover,
         * next load balanced node will be picked for job execution. Also jobs
         * will never be re-routed to the nodes they have failed on. This
         * behavior can be changed by configuring any of the existing or a
         * custom FailoverSpi in grid configuration.
         *
         * @par Computation SPIs
         * Note that regardless of which method is used for executing
         * computations, all relevant SPI implementations configured for this
         * compute instance will be used (i.e. failover, load balancing,
         * collision resolution, checkpoints, etc.).
