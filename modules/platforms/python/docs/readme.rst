What it is
----------

This is an Apache Ignite thin (binary protocol) client library,
written in Python 3, abbreviated as *pyignite*.

`Apache Ignite`_ is a memory-centric distributed database, caching,
and processing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming
workloads delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale.

Ignite `binary client protocol`_ provides user applications the ability
to communicate with an existing Ignite cluster without starting
a full-fledged Ignite node. An application can connect to the cluster
through a raw TCP socket.

Prerequisites
-------------

- *Python 3.4* or above (3.6 is tested),
- Access to *Apache Ignite* node, local or remote. The current thin client
  version was tested on *Apache Ignite 2.7.0* (binary client protocol 1.2.0).


Installation
------------

for end user
""""""""""""

If you want to use *pyignite* in your project, you may install it from PyPI:

::

$ pip install pyignite

for developer
"""""""""""""

If you want to run tests, examples or build documentation, clone
the whole repository:

::

$ git clone git@github.com:apache/ignite.git
$ git checkout ignite-7782
$ cd ignite/modules/platforms/python
$ pip install -e .

This will install the repository version of `pyignite` into your environment
in so-called “develop” or “editable” mode. You may read more about
`editable installs`_ in the `pip` manual.

Then run through the contents of `requirements` folder to install
the the additional requirements into your working Python environment using

::

$ pip install -r requirements/<your task>.txt

You may also want to consult the `setuptools`_ manual about using `setup.py`.

Examples
--------

Some examples of using pyignite are provided in
`ignite/modules/platforms/python/examples` folder. They are extensively
commented in the :ref:`examples_of_usage` section of the documentation.

This code implies that it is run in the environment with `pyignite` package
installed, and Apache Ignite node is running on localhost:10800, unless
otherwise noted.

There is also a possibility to run examples alone with tests. For
the explanation of testing, look up the `Testing`_ section.

Testing
-------

Create and activate virtualenv_ environment. Run

::

$ cd ignite/modules/platforms/python
$ python ./setup.py pytest

This does not require `pytest` and other test dependencies to be installed
in your environment.

Some or all tests require Apache Ignite node running on localhost:10800.
To override the default parameters, use command line options
``--ignite-host`` and ``--ignite-port``:

::

$ python ./setup.py pytest --addopts "--ignite-host=example.com --ignite-port=19840"

You can use each of these two options multiple times. All combinations
of given host and port will be tested.

You can also test client against a server with SSL-encrypted connection.
SSL-related `pytest` parameters are:

``--use-ssl`` − use SSL encryption,

``--ssl-certfile`` − a path to ssl certificate file to identify local party,

``--ssl-ca-certfile`` − a path to a trusted certificate or a certificate chain,

``--ssl-cert-reqs`` − determines how the remote side certificate is treated:

- ``NONE`` (ignore, default),
- ``OPTIONAL`` (validate, if provided),
- ``REQUIRED`` (valid remote certificate is required),

``--ssl-ciphers`` − ciphers to use,

``--ssl-version`` − SSL version:

- ``TLSV1_1`` (default),
- ``TLSV1_2``.

Other `pytest` parameters:

``--timeout`` − timeout (in seconds) for each socket operation, including
`connect`. Accepts integer or float value. Default is None (blocking mode),

``--username`` and ``--password`` − credentials to authenticate to Ignite
cluster. Used in conjunction with `authenticationEnabled` property in cluster
configuration.

``--examples`` − run the examples as one test. If you wish to run *only*
the examples, supply also the name of the test function to `pytest` launcher:

::

$ pytest --examples ../tests/test_examples.py::test_examples

In this test assertion fails if any of the examples' processes ends with
non-zero exit code.

Examples are not parameterized for the sake of simplicity. They always run
with default parameters (host and port) regardless of any other
`pytest` option.

Since failover, SSL and authentication examples are meant to be controlled
by user or depends on special configuration of the Ignite cluster, they
can not be automated.

Documentation
-------------
To recompile this documentation, do this from your virtualenv_ environment:

::

$ cd ignite/modules/platforms/python
$ pip install -r requirements/docs.txt
$ cd docs
$ make html

Then open `ignite/modules/platforms/python/docs/generated/html/index.html`_
in your browser.

If you feel that old version is stuck, do

::

$ cd ignite/modules/platforms/python/docs
$ make clean
$ sphinx-apidoc -feM -o source/ ../ ../setup.py
$ make html

And that should be it.
