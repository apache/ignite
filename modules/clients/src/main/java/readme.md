Java Client is a **lightweight gateway** to GridGain nodes. 

![GridGain Logo](http://www.gridgain.com/images/java_logo_small.png "Java Logo")

Client communicates with grid nodes via REST interface and provides reduced but powerful subset of GridGain API. Java Client allows to use GridGain features from devices and environments where fully-functional GridGain node could not (*or should not*) be started.
