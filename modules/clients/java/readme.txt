Java Client README

Java Client is a lightweight gateway to GridGain nodes. Client communicates with grid nodes via REST interface and
provides reduced but powerful subset of GridGain API. Java Client allows to use GridGain features from devices and
environments where fully-functional GridGain node could not (or should not) be started.
