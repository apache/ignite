# Overview
The `ignitetest` framework provides basic functionality and services
to write integration tests for Apache Ignite. This framework bases on 
the `ducktape` test framework, for information about it check the links:
- https://github.com/confluentinc/ducktape - source code of the `ducktape`.
- http://ducktape-docs.readthedocs.io - documentation to the `ducktape`.

Structure of the `tests` directory is:
- `./ignitetest/services` contains basic services functionality.
- `./ignitetest/utils` contains utils for testing.
- `./ignitetest/tests` contains tests.
- `./checks` contains unit tests of utils, tests' decorators etc. 

# Local run
Docker is used to emulate distributed environment. Single container represents 
a running node.

## Requirements
To just start tests locally the only requirement is preinstalled `docker`. 
For development process requirements are `python` >= 3.7.

## Run tests
- Change a current directory to`${IGNITE_HOME}`
- Build Apache IGNITE invoking `${IGNITE_HOME}/scripts/build-module.sh ducktests`
- Change a current directory to `${IGNITE_HOME}/modules/ducktests/tests`
- Run tests in docker containers using a following command:
```
./docker/run_tests.sh
```
- For detailed help and instructions, use a following command:
```
./docker/run_tests.sh --help
```
- Test reports, including service logs, are located in the `${IGNITE_HOME}/results` directory.

## Runned tests management
- Tear down all the currently active ducker-ignite nodes using a following command:
```
./docker/clean_up.sh
```

# Real environment run
[Ducktape](https://ducktape-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) allow runs on 
Custom cluster, Vagrant, K8s, Mesos, Docker, cloud providers, etc.

## Requirements
- Set up the cluster.
  See `./docker/Dockerfile` for servers setup hints.

## Run tests
- Change a current directory to`${IGNITE_HOME}`
- Build Apache IGNITE invoking `${IGNITE_HOME}/scripts/build-module.sh ducktests`
- Run tests using [Ducktape](https://ducktape-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_tests.html). \
  For example:
  ```
  ducktape --results-root=./results --cluster-file=./cluster.json --repeat 1 --max-parallel 16 ./modules/ducktests/tests/ignitetest
  ```
# Custom Ignites (forks) testing
## Run all tests
### Setup
Any version of Apache Ignite, or it's fork, can be tested. 
Binary releases supported as well as compiled sources. 

- Binary releases should be located at `/opt` directory, eg. `/opt/ignite-2.11.0`.
- Source releases also should be located at `/opt` directory, but should be compiled before the first use.\
  Use the following command to compile sources properly:
  ```
  ./scripts/build-module.sh ducktests
  ```
You may replace `/opt` with custom directory by setting `install_root` globals param. \
For example, `--globals-json, eg: {"install_root": "/dir42"}`

### Execution
You may set versions (products) using `@ignite_versions` decorator at code
```
@ignite_versions(str(DEV_BRANCH), str(LATEST))
```
or passing versions set via globals during the execution
```
--globals-json, eg: {"ignite_versions":["2.8.1", "dev"]}
```
You may also specify product prefix by `project` param at globals, for example:
```
--globals-json, eg: {"project": "fork" ,"ignite_versions": ["ignite-2.8.1", "2.8.1", "dev"]}
```
will execute tests on `ignite-2.8.1, fork-2.8.1, fork-dev`

## Run tests from the external source/repository

# Special runs
## Run with enabled security
### Run with SSL enabled

### Run with build-in authentication enabled

# Development
## Preparing development environment
- Create a virtual environment and activate it using following commands:
```
python3 -m venv ~/.virtualenvs/ignite-ducktests-dev
source ~/.virtualenvs/ignite-ducktests-dev/bin/activate
```
- Change a current directory to `${IGNITE_HOME}/modules/ducktests/tests`. We refer to it as `${DUCKTESTS_DIR}`.
- Install requirements and `ignitetests` as editable using following commands:
```
pip install -r docker/requirements-dev.txt
pip install -e .
```
---

- For running unit tests invoke `pytest` in `${DUCKTESTS_DIR}`.
- For checking codestyle invoke `flake8` in `${DUCKTESTS_DIR}`.
- For running linter invoke `pylint --rcfile=tox.ini ignitetests checks` in `${DUCKTESTS_DIR}`.

#### Run checks over multiple python's versions using tox (optional)
All commits and PR's are checked against multiple python's version, namely 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8.
If you want to check your PR as it will be checked on Travis CI, you should do following steps:

- Install `pyenv`, see installation instruction [here](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).
- Install different versions of python (recommended versions are `3.7.9` and `3.8.5`)
- Activate them with a command `pyenv shell 3.7.9 3.8.5`
- Install `tox` by invoking a command `pip install tox`
- Change a current directory to `${DUCKTESTS_DIR}` and invoke `tox`
