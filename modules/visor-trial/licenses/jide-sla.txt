A Single Developer License for the SOFTWARE PRODUCT may not be shared or used by more than one individual developer. In a project that uses the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, each individual developer on the project requires a separate Single Developer License as long as they need to write code using JIDE API. 
B.	Source Code License. In addition to the license and rights granted above, JIDE grants you the right to use and modify the JIDE source provided you licensed source code. Different from developer license, source code license is licensed to a team. Each team only needs to purchase one copy of source code license and share it among those developers who have their own Single Developer License.
I.	JIDE shall retain all right, title and interest in and to all updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works, in whole or in part, of the JIDE Source Code created by you, including all copyrights subsisting therein, to the extent such modifications, enhancements or derivative works contain copyrightable code or expression derived from the JIDE source code; provided, however, that JIDE grants to you a fully-paid, royalty free license, to use copy and modify such updates, modifications, enhancements and derivative works or copies thereof for use as authorized in this LICENSE. 
II.	You may not distribute the JIDE source code, or any modified version or derivative work of the JIDE source code, in source code form. 
III.	JIDE require all developers in your project who plan to access JIDE source code signing on the source code license. As long as they signed, they become registered developers. An alternative to this is to let a delegate signs source code license as an organization. The delegate will be responsible for letting other developers who plan to access the source code reviewing this license agreement first before releasing them the access. 
IV.	The source code contained herein and in related files is provided to the registered developer for the purposes of education and troubleshooting. Under no circumstances may any portion of the source code be distributed, disclosed or otherwise made available to any third party without the express written consent of JIDE. 
V.	Under no circumstances may the source code be used in whole or in part, as the basis for creating a product that provides the same, or substantially the same, functionality as any JIDE products. 
VI.	The registered developer acknowledges that this source code contains valuable and proprietary trade secrets of JIDE. The registered developer agrees to expend every effort to insure its confidentiality. For example, under no circumstances may the registered developer allow to put the source code on an internal network where he or she has no control.
VII.	Due to the insecurity of Java byte-code, if you plan to use classes that built from the source code directly, you must agree to obfuscate the classes before distributing it to your customers. 
VIII.	SOURCE CODE IS SOLD AS IS. JIDE DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY TECHNICAL SUPPORT FOR SOURCE CODE. 
C.	Annual Maintenance Renewal. Maintenance includes both technical support and product updates. The initial purchase of Single Developer License includes three month maintenance for free. After that period, you need to purchase Annual Maintenance Renewal in order to continue receiving technical support, product updates.

You can acknowledge using JIDE by showing JIDE name and/or logo in about dialog, or splash screen or including this SLA in a license folder of your product release where has the licenses for all 3rd party libraries you are using or any other places where users can easily notice.
