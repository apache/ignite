Selects data from a table or multiple tables.

Command is executed in the following logical order:

1. Data is taken from table value expressions that are specified in the FROM clause, joins are executed.
If FROM clause is not specified a single row is constructed.

2. WHERE filters rows. Aggregate or window functions are not allowed in this clause.

3. GROUP BY groups the result by the given expression(s).
If GROUP BY clause is not specified, but non-window aggregate functions are used or HAVING is specified
all rows are grouped together.

4. Aggregate functions are evaluated, SAMPLE_SIZE limits the number of rows read.

5. HAVING filters rows after grouping and evaluation of aggregate functions.
Non-window aggregate functions are allowed in this clause.

6. Window functions are evaluated.

7. QUALIFY filters rows after evaluation of window functions.
Aggregate and window functions are allowed in this clause.

8. DISTINCT removes duplicates.
If DISTINCT ON is used only the specified expressions are checked for duplicates;
ORDER BY clause, if any, is used to determine preserved rows.
First row is each DISTINCT ON group is preserved.
In absence of ORDER BY preserved rows are not determined, database may choose any row from each DISTINCT ON group.

9. UNION, EXCEPT (MINUS), and INTERSECT combine the result of this query with the results of another query.
Multiple set operators (UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS, EXCEPT) are evaluated from left to right.
For compatibility with other databases and future versions of H2 please use parentheses.

10. ORDER BY sorts the result by the given column(s) or expression(s).

11. Number of rows in output can be limited either with standard OFFSET / FETCH,
with non-standard LIMIT / OFFSET, or with non-standard TOP clauses.
Different clauses cannot be used together.
OFFSET specifies how many rows to skip.
Please note that queries with high offset values can be slow.
FETCH FIRST/NEXT, LIMIT or TOP limits the number of rows returned by the query (no limit if null or smaller than zero).
If PERCENT is specified number of rows is specified as a percent of the total number of rows
and should be an integer value between 0 and 100 inclusive.
WITH TIES can be used only together with ORDER BY and means that all additional rows that have the same sorting position
as the last row will be also returned.

WINDOW clause specifies window definitions for window functions and window aggregate functions.
This clause can be used to reuse the same definition in multiple functions.

If FOR UPDATE is specified, the tables or rows are locked for writing.
This clause is not allowed in DISTINCT queries and in queries with non-window aggregates, GROUP BY, or HAVING clauses.
When using default MVStore engine only the selected rows are locked as in an UPDATE statement.
Rows from the right side of a left join and from the left side of a right join, including nested joins, aren't locked.
Locking behavior for rows that were excluded from result using OFFSET / FETCH / LIMIT / TOP or QUALIFY is undefined,
to avoid possible locking of excessive rows try to filter out unneeded rows with the WHERE criteria when possible.
Rows are processed one by one. Committed row is read, tested with WHERE criteria, locked, read again and re-tested,
because its value may be changed by concurrent transaction before lock acquisition.
Note that new uncommitted rows from other transactions are not visible due to read committed isolation level
and therefore cannot be locked.
With PageStore engine the whole tables are locked;
to avoid deadlocks with this engine always lock the tables in the same order in all transactions.

"Commands (DML)","RUNSCRIPT","
RUNSCRIPT FROM fileNameString scriptCompressionEncryption
[ CHARSET charsetString ]
","
Runs a SQL script from a file. The script is a text file containing SQL
statements; each statement must end with ';'. This command can be used to
restore a database from a backup. The password must be in single quotes; it is
case sensitive and can contain spaces.

Instead of a file name, an URL may be used.
To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix 'classpath:'.
See the Pluggable File System section on the Advanced page.

The compression algorithm must match the one used when creating the script.
Instead of a file, an URL may be used.

[ SCHEMA schemaName [, ...] ]
","
Creates a SQL script from the database.

NODATA will not emit INSERT statements.
SIMPLE does not use multi-row insert statements.
COLUMNS includes column name lists into insert statements.
If the DROP option is specified, drop statements are created for tables, views,
and sequences. If the block size is set, CLOB and BLOB values larger than this
size are split into separate blocks.
BLOCKSIZE is used when writing out LOB data, and specifies the point at the
values transition from being inserted as inline values, to be inserted using
out-of-line commands.
NOSETTINGS turns off dumping the database settings (the SET XXX commands)

If no 'TO fileName' clause is specified, the
script is returned as a result set. This command can be used to create a backup
of the database. For long term storage, it is more portable than copying the
database files.

If a 'TO fileName' clause is specified, then the whole
script (including insert statements) is written to this file, and a result set
without the insert statements is returned.

The password must be in single quotes; it is case sensitive and can contain spaces.

This command locks objects while it is running.
Admin rights are required to execute this command.

When using the TABLE or SCHEMA option, only the selected table(s) / schema(s) are included.

Changes the data type of a column, rename a column,
change the identity value, or change the selectivity.

Changing the data type fails if the data can not be converted.

RESTART changes the next value of an auto increment column.
The column must already be an auto increment column.
For RESTART, the same transactional rules as for ALTER SEQUENCE apply.

SELECTIVITY sets the selectivity (1-100) for a column.
Setting the selectivity to 0 means the default value.
Selectivity is used by the cost based optimizer to calculate the estimated cost of an index.
Selectivity 100 means values are unique, 10 means every distinct value appears 10 times on average.

SET DEFAULT changes the default value of a column.

DROP DEFAULT removes the default value of a column.

SET ON UPDATE changes the value that is set on update if value for this column is not specified in update statement.

DROP ON UPDATE removes the value that is set on update of a column.

SET NOT NULL sets a column to not allow NULL. Rows may not contains NULL in this column.

DROP NOT NULL and SET NULL set a column to allow NULL. The row may not be part of a primary key.

SET DATA TYPE changes the data type of a column.

SET INVISIBLE makes the column hidden, i.e. it will not appear in SELECT * results.

Creates a new function alias. If this is a ResultSet returning function,
by default the return value is cached in a local temporary file.

NOBUFFER - disables caching of ResultSet return value to temporary file.

DETERMINISTIC - Deterministic functions must always return the same value for the same parameters.

The method name must be the full qualified class and method name,
and may optionally include the parameter classes as in
""java.lang.Integer.parseInt(java.lang.String, int)"". The class and the method
must both be public, and the method must be static. The class must be available
in the classpath of the database engine (when using the server mode,
it must be in the classpath of the server).

When defining a function alias with source code, the Sun ""javac"" is compiler
is used if the file ""tools.jar"" is in the classpath. If not, ""javac"" is run as a separate process.
Only the source code is stored in the database; the class is compiled each time
the database is re-opened. Source code is usually passed
as dollar quoted text to avoid escaping problems. If import statements are used,
then the tag @CODE must be added before the method.

If the method throws an SQLException, it is directly re-thrown to the calling application;
all other exceptions are first converted to a SQLException.

If the first parameter of the Java function is a ""java.sql.Connection"", then a
connection to the database is provided. This connection must not be closed.

Creates a table link to an external table. The driver name may be empty if the
driver is already loaded. If the schema name is not set, only one table with
that name may exist in the target database.

FORCE - Create the LINKED TABLE even if the remote database/table does not exist.

EMIT UPDATES - Usually, for update statements, the old rows are deleted first and then the new
rows are inserted. It is possible to emit update statements (except on
rollback), however in this case multi-row unique key updates may not always
work. Linked tables to the same database share one connection.

READONLY - is set, the remote table may not be updated. This is enforced by H2.

If the connection to the source database is lost, the connection is re-opened
(this is a workaround for MySQL that disconnects after 8 hours of inactivity by default).

If a query is used instead of the original table name, the table is read only.
Queries must be enclosed in parenthesis: ""(SELECT * FROM ORDERS)"".

To use JNDI to get the connection, the driver class must be a
javax.naming.Context (for example ""javax.naming.InitialContext""), and the URL must

CREATE SEQUENCE [ IF NOT EXISTS ] newSequenceName

","
Creates a new sequence.
The data type of a sequence is BIGINT.
Used values are never re-used, even when the transaction is rolled back.

The cache is the number of pre-allocated numbers.
If the system crashes without closing the database, at most this many numbers are lost.
The default cache size is 32.
To disable caching, use the cache size 1 or lower.

[ NOT PERSISTENT ] [ TRANSACTIONAL ]
[ AS select [ WITH [ NO ] DATA ] ]","
Creates a new table.

Cached tables (the default for regular tables) are persistent,
and the number of rows is not limited by the main memory.
Memory tables (the default for temporary tables) are persistent,
but the index data is kept in main memory,
that means memory tables should not get too large.

Temporary tables are deleted when closing or opening a database.
Temporary tables can be global (accessible by all connections)
or local (only accessible by the current connection).
The default for temporary tables is global.
Indexes of temporary tables are kept fully in main memory,
unless the temporary table is created using CREATE CACHED TABLE.

The ENGINE option is only required when custom table implementations are used.
The table engine class must implement the interface ""org.h2.api.TableEngine"".
Any table engine parameters are passed down in the tableEngineParams field of the CreateTableData object.

Either ENGINE, or WITH (table engine params), or both may be specified. If ENGINE is not specified
in CREATE TABLE, then the engine specified by DEFAULT_TABLE_ENGINE option of database params is used.

Tables with the NOT PERSISTENT modifier are kept fully in memory, and all
rows are lost when the database is closed.

The column definitions are optional if a query is specified.
In that case the column list of the query is used.
If the query is specified its results are inserted into created table unless WITH NO DATA is specified.

This command commits an open transaction, except when using
TRANSACTIONAL (only supported for temporary tables).

{ INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | SELECT | ROLLBACK }
[,...] ON tableName [ FOR EACH ROW ]
[ QUEUE int ] [ NOWAIT ]
{ CALL triggeredClassName | AS sourceCodeString }
","
Creates a new trigger.
The trigger class must be public and implement ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
Inner classes are not supported.
The class must be available in the classpath of the database engine
(when using the server mode, it must be in the classpath of the server).

The sourceCodeString must define a single method with no parameters that returns ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
See CREATE ALIAS for requirements regarding the compilation.
Alternatively, javax.script.ScriptEngineManager can be used to create an instance of ""org.h2.api.Trigger"".
Currently javascript (included in every JRE) and ruby (with JRuby) are supported.
In that case the source must begin respectively with ""//javascript"" or ""#ruby"".

BEFORE triggers are called after data conversion is made, default values are set,
null and length constraint checks have been made;
but before other constraints have been checked.
If there are multiple triggers, the order in which they are called is undefined.

ROLLBACK can be specified in combination with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.
Only row based AFTER trigger can be called on ROLLBACK.
Exceptions that occur within such triggers are ignored.
As the operations that occur within a trigger are part of the transaction,
ROLLBACK triggers are only required if an operation communicates outside of the database.

INSTEAD OF triggers are implicitly row based and behave like BEFORE triggers.
Only the first such trigger is called. Such triggers on views are supported.
They can be used to make views updatable.

A BEFORE SELECT trigger is fired just before the database engine tries to read from the table.
The trigger can be used to update a table on demand.
The trigger is called with both 'old' and 'new' set to null.

The MERGE statement will call both INSERT and UPDATE triggers.
Not supported are SELECT triggers with the option FOR EACH ROW,
and AFTER SELECT triggers.

Committing or rolling back a transaction within a trigger is not allowed, except for SELECT triggers.

By default a trigger is called once for each statement, without the old and new rows.
FOR EACH ROW triggers are called once for each inserted, updated, or deleted row.

QUEUE is implemented for syntax compatibility with HSQL and has no effect.

The trigger need to be created in the same schema as the table.
The schema name does not need to be specified when creating the trigger.

Sets the transaction log mode. The values 0, 1, and 2 are supported, the default is 2.
This setting affects all connections.

LOG 0 means the transaction log is disabled completely. It is the fastest mode,
but also the most dangerous: if the process is killed while the database is open in this mode,
the data might be lost. It must only be used if this is not a problem, for example when
initially loading a database, or when running tests.

LOG 1 means the transaction log is enabled, but FileDescriptor.sync is disabled.
This setting is about half as fast as with LOG 0. This setting is useful if no protection
against power failure is required, but the data must be protected against killing the process.

LOG 2 (the default) means the transaction log is enabled, and FileDescriptor.sync is called
for each checkpoint. This setting is about half as fast as LOG 1. Depending on the
file system, this will also protect against power failure in the majority if cases.

SHUTDOWN COMPACT fully compacts the database (re-creating the database may further reduce the database size).
If the database is closed normally (using SHUTDOWN or by closing all connections), then the database is also compacted,
but only for at most the time defined by the database setting ""h2.maxCompactTime"" in milliseconds (see there).

SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATELY closes the database files without any cleanup and without compacting.

SHUTDOWN DEFRAG re-orders the pages when closing the database so that table scans are faster. In case of MVStore it is currently equivalent to COMPACT.

The right hand side of a condition.

Quantified comparison predicate ALL returns TRUE if specified comparison operation between
left size of condition and each row from a subquery returns TRUE, including case when there are no rows.
ALL predicate returns FALSE if at least one such comparison returns FALSE.
Otherwise it returns NULL.

Quantified comparison predicates ANY and SOME return TRUE if specified comparison operation between
left size of condition and at least one row from a subquery returns TRUE.
ANY and SOME predicates return FALSE if all such comparisons return FALSE.
Otherwise it returns NULL.
Note that these predicates have priority over ANY and SOME aggregate functions with subquery on the right side.
Use parentheses around aggregate function.

The conditions ""IS [ NOT ]"" and ""IS [ NOT ] DISTINCT FROM"" are null-safe, meaning
NULL is considered the same as NULL, and the condition never evaluates to NULL.

When comparing with LIKE, the wildcards characters are ""_"" (any one character)
and ""%"" (any characters). The database uses an index when comparing with LIKE
except if the operand starts with a wildcard. To search for the characters ""%"" and
""_"", the characters need to be escaped. The default escape character is "" \ "" (backslash).
To select no escape character, use ""ESCAPE ''"" (empty string).
At most one escape character is allowed.
Each character that follows the escape character in the pattern needs to match exactly.
Patterns that end with an escape character are invalid and the expression returns NULL.

ILIKE does a case-insensitive compare.

Optional parameters for CSVREAD and CSVWRITE.
Instead of setting the options one by one, all options can be
combined into a space separated key-value pairs, as follows:
""STRINGDECODE('charset=UTF-8 escape=\"" fieldDelimiter=\"" fieldSeparator=, ' ||""
""'lineComment=# lineSeparator=\n null= rowSeparator=')"".
The following options are supported:

""caseSensitiveColumnNames"" (true or false; disabled by default),

""charset"" (for example 'UTF-8'),

""escape"" (the character that escapes the field delimiter),

""fieldDelimiter"" (a double quote by default),

""fieldSeparator"" (a comma by default),

""lineComment"" (disabled by default),

""lineSeparator"" (the line separator used for writing; ignored for reading),

""null"", Support reading existing CSV files that contain explicit ""null"" delimiters.
Note that an empty, unquoted values are also treated as null.

""preserveWhitespace"" (true or false; disabled by default),

""writeColumnHeader"" (true or false; enabled by default).

For a newline or other special character, use STRINGDECODE as in the example above.
A space needs to be escaped with a backslash (""'\ '""), and
a backslash needs to be escaped with another backslash (""'\\'"").
All other characters are not to be escaped, that means
newline and tab characters are written as such.

A window frame clause.
May be specified only for aggregates and FIRST_VALUE(), LAST_VALUE(), and NTH_VALUE() window functions.

If this clause is not specified for an aggregate or window function that supports this clause
the default window frame depends on window order clause.
If window order clause is also not specified
the default window frame contains all the rows in the partition.
If window order clause is specified
the default window frame contains all preceding rows and all rows from the current group.

Window frame unit determines how rows or groups of rows are selected and counted.
If ROWS is specified rows are not grouped in any way and relative numbers of rows are used in bounds.
If RANGE is specified rows are grouped according window order clause,
preceding and following values mean the difference between value in the current row and in the target rows,
and CURRENT ROW in bound specification means current group of rows.
If GROUPS is specified rows are grouped according window order clause,
preceding and following values means relative number of groups of rows,
and CURRENT ROW in bound specification means current group of rows.

If only window frame preceding clause is specified it is treated as
BETWEEN windowFramePreceding AND CURRENT ROW.

Optional window frame exclusion clause specifies rows that should be excluded from the frame.
EXCLUDE CURRENT ROW excludes only the current row regardless the window frame unit.
EXCLUDE GROUP excludes the whole current group of rows, including the current row.
EXCLUDE TIES excludes the current group of rows, but not the current row.

"Functions (System)","CSVREAD","
CSVREAD(fileNameString [, columnsString [, csvOptions ] ] )
","
Returns the result set of reading the CSV (comma separated values) file.
For each parameter, NULL means the default value should be used.

If the column names are specified (a list of column names separated with the
fieldSeparator), those are used, otherwise (or if they are set to NULL) the first line of
the file is interpreted as the column names.
In that case, column names that contain no special characters (only letters, '_',
and digits; similar to the rule for Java identifiers) are considered case insensitive.
Other column names are case sensitive, that means you need to use quoted identifiers
(see below).

The default charset is the default value for this system, and the default field separator
is a comma. Missing unquoted values as well as data that matches nullString is
parsed as NULL. All columns of type VARCHAR.

The BOM (the byte-order-mark) character 0xfeff at the beginning of the file is ignored.

This function can be used like a table: ""SELECT * FROM CSVREAD(...)"".

Instead of a file, an URL may be used, for example
""jar:file:///c:/temp/example.zip!/org/example/nested.csv"".
To read a stream from the classpath, use the prefix ""classpath:"".
To read from HTTP, use the prefix ""http:"" (as in a browser).

For performance reason, CSVREAD should not be used inside a join.

Writes a CSV (comma separated values). The file is overwritten if it exists.
If only a file name is specified, it will be written to the current working directory.
For each parameter, NULL means the default value should be used.
The default charset is the default value for this system, and the default field separator is a comma.

The values are converted to text using the default string representation;
if another conversion is required you need to change the select statement accordingly.
The parameter nullString is used when writing NULL (by default nothing is written
when NULL appears). The default line separator is the default value for this
system (system property ""line.separator"").

The returned value is the number or rows written.
