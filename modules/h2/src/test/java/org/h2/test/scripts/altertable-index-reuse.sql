-- adds constraint on (domain,username) and generates unique index domainusername_key_INDEX_xxx
ALTER TABLE "users" ADD CONSTRAINT "domainusername_key" UNIQUE ("domain","username");

-- adds foreign key on domain - if domainusername_key didn't exist it would create unique index on domain, but it reuses the existing index

-- now we drop the domainusername_key, but domainusername_key_INDEX_xxx is used by udomain_fkey and was not being dropped
-- this was an issue, because it's a unique index and still enforcing constraint on (domain,username)

-- should work,because we dropped domainusername_key, but failed: Unique index or primary key violation
