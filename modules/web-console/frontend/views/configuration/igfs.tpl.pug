            li IGFS can either work as purely in-memory file system, or delegate to another file system (e.g. various Hadoop file system implementations) acting as a caching layer (see #[a(href='https://apacheignite-fs.readme.io/docs/secondary-file-system' target='_blank') secondary file system]  for more detail)
            li In addition IGFS provides API to execute map-reduce tasks over file system data
