Building from Ignite sources
=========================================

Run

mvn clean package -Pyardstick -pl modules/yardstick -am -DskipTests

in the Apache Ignite root directory.

This command will compile the project and also unpack scripts from `yardstick-resources.zip` file to
`modules/yardstick/target/assembly/bin` directory.

Artifacts can be found in `modules/yardstick/target/assembly` directory.

Building from Ignite sources with ML Grid benchmarks
====================================================

You need Java 8 or higher and "ml" profile enabled. Run

mvn clean package -Pyardstick -Pml -pl modules/yardstick -am -DskipTests

in the Apache Ignite root directory.

Writing Ignite Benchmarks
=========================

All benchmarks extend `AbstractBenchmark` class. A new benchmark should also extend this abstract class
and implement `test` method. This is the method which actually tests performance.
