/**
 * A serializer that writes a sequence of fixed bit-width 'words' to a byte array.
 * Bitwise OR is used to write words into bytes, so a low bit in a word is also
 * a low bit in a byte. However, a high byte in a word is written at a lower index
 * in the array than a low byte in a word. The first word is written at the lowest
 * array index. Each serializer is one time use and returns its backing byte
 * array.<p/>
 *
 * This encoding was chosen so that when reading bytes as octets in the typical
 * first-octet-is-the-high-nibble fashion, an octet-to-binary conversion
 * would yield a high-to-low, left-to-right view of the "short words".<p/>
 *
 * Example:<p/>
 *
 * Say short words are 5 bits wide. Our word sequence is the values
 * <code>[31, 1, 5]</code>. In big-endian binary format, the values are
 * <code>[0b11111, 0b00001, 0b00101]</code>. We use 15 of 16 bits in two bytes
 * and pad the last (lowest) bit of the last byte with a zero:
 *
 * <code>
 *  [0b11111000, 0b01001010] = [0xF8, 0x4A]
 * </code>.
