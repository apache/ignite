            Events and Performance
            Note that by default all events in Ignite are enabled and therefore generated and stored by
            whatever event storage SPI is configured. Ignite can and often does generate thousands events per
            seconds under the load and therefore it creates a significant additional load on the system. If
            these events are not needed by the application this load is unnecessary and leads to significant
            performance degradation.

            It is highly recommended to enable only those events that your application logic requires by using
            either IgniteConfiguration.getExcludeEventTypes() or IgniteConfiguration.getIncludeEventTypes() methods
            in Ignite configuration. Note that certain events are required for Ignite's internal operations
            and such events will still be generated but not stored by event storage SPI if they are disabled in
            Ignite configuration.
