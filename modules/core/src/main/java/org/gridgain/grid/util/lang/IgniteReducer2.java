 * that returns optional value on each execution of the closure - the reducer returns a single
 * value for one or more collected values.
 * <p>
 * Closures are a first-class functions that are defined with
 * (or closed over) their free variables that are bound to the closure scope at execution. Since
 * Java 6 doesn't provide a language construct for first-class function the closures are implemented
 * as abstract classes.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Note that this interface does not impose or assume any specific thread-safety by its
 * implementations. Each implementation can elect what type of thread-safety it provides,
 * if any.
 * @param <E1> Type of the first free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called on.
 * @param <E2> Type of the second free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called on.
