/**
 * Main API for configuring and executing cache queries.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">SQL Queries</h1>
 * {@code SQL} query allows to execute distributed cache
 * queries using standard SQL syntax. All values participating in where clauses
 * or joins must be annotated with {@link QuerySqlField} annotation.
 * <h2 class="header">Field Queries</h2>
 * By default {@code select} clause is ignored as query result contains full objects.
 * This type of query replaces full objects with individual fields. Note that selected fields
 * must be annotated with {@link QuerySqlField} annotation.
 * <h2 class="header">Cross-Cache Queries</h2>
 * You are allowed to query data from several caches. Cache that this query was created on is
 * treated as default schema in this case. Other caches can be referenced by their names.
 * <p>
 * Note that cache name is case sensitive and has to always be specified in double quotes.
 * Here is an example of cross cache query (note that 'replicated' and 'partitioned' are
 * cache names for replicated and partitioned caches accordingly):
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * CacheQuery&lt;Map.Entry&lt;Integer, FactPurchase&gt;&gt; storePurchases = cache.queries().createSqlQuery(
 *     Purchase.class,
 *     "from \"replicated\".Store, \"partitioned\".Purchase where Store.id=Purchase.storeId and Store.id=?");
 * </pre>
 * <h2 class="header">Custom functions in SQL queries.</h2>
 * It is possible to write custom Java methods and call then form SQL queries. These methods must be public static
 * and annotated with {@link QuerySqlFunction}. Classes containing these methods must be registered in
 * {@link org.apache.ignite.configuration.CacheConfiguration#setSqlFunctionClasses(Class[])}.
 * <h1 class="header">Full Text Queries</h1>
 * Ignite supports full text queries based on Apache Lucene engine. Note that all fields that
 * are expected to show up in text query results must be annotated with {@link QueryTextField}
 * annotation.
 * <h1 class="header">Scan Queries</h1>
 * Sometimes when it is known in advance that SQL query will cause a full data scan, or whenever data set
 * is relatively small, the full scan query may be used. This query will iterate over all cache
 * entries, skipping over entries that don't pass the optionally provided key-value filter.
 * <h2 class="header">Limitations</h2>
 * Data in Ignite cache is usually distributed across several nodes,
 * so some queries may not work as expected. Keep in mind following limitations
 * (not applied if data is queried from one node only):
 * <ul>
 *     <li>
 *         {@code Group by} and {@code sort by} statements are applied separately
 *         on each node, so result set will likely be incorrectly grouped or sorted
 *         after results from multiple remote nodes are grouped together.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Aggregation functions like {@code sum}, {@code max}, {@code avg}, etc.
 *         are also applied on each node. Therefore you will get several results
 *         containing aggregated values, one for each node.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Joins will work correctly only if joined objects are stored in
 *         colocated mode or at least one side of the join is stored in
 *         {@link org.apache.ignite.cache.CacheMode#REPLICATED} cache. Refer to
 *         {@link AffinityKey} javadoc for more information about colocation.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Query usage</h1>
 * As an example, suppose we have data model consisting of {@code 'Employee'} and {@code 'Organization'}
 * classes defined as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class Organization {
 *     // Indexed field.
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField(index = true)
 *     private long id;
 *
 *     // Indexed field.
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField(index = true)
 *     private String name;
 *     ...
 * }
 *
 * public class Person {
 *     // Indexed field.
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField(index = true)
 *     private long id;
 *
 *     // Indexed field (Organization ID, used as a foreign key).
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField(index = true)
 *     private long orgId;
 *
 *     // Without SQL field annotation, this field cannot be used in queries.
 *     private String name;
 *
 *     // Not indexed field.
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField
 *     private double salary;
 *
 *     // Index for text search.
 *     &#64;QueryTextField
 *     private String resume;
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Then you can create and execute queries that check various salary ranges like so:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * Cache&lt;Long, Person&gt; cache = G.grid().cache();
 * ...
 * // Create query which selects salaries based on range for all employees
 * // that work for a certain company.
 * CacheQuery&lt;Map.Entry&lt;Long, Person&gt;&gt; qry = cache.queries().createSqlQuery(Person.class,
 *     "from Person, Organization where Person.orgId = Organization.id " +
 *         "and Organization.name = ? and Person.salary &gt; ? and Person.salary &lt;= ?");
 *
 * // Query all nodes to find all cached Ignite employees
 * // with salaries less than 1000.
 * qry.execute("Ignition", 0, 1000);
 *
 * // Query only remote nodes to find all remotely cached Ignite employees
 * // with salaries greater than 1000 and less than 2000.
 * qry.projection(grid.remoteProjection()).execute("Ignition", 1000, 2000);
 * </pre>
 * Here is a possible query that will use Lucene text search to scan all resumes to
 * check if employees have {@code Master} degree:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * CacheQuery&lt;Map.Entry&lt;Long, Person&gt;&gt; mastersQry =
 *     cache.queries().createFullTextQuery(Person.class, "Master");
 *
 * // Query all cache nodes.
 * mastersQry.execute();
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Geo-Spatial Indexes and Queries</h1>
 * Ignite also support <b>Geo-Spatial Indexes</b>. Here is an example of geo-spatial index:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * private class MapPoint implements Serializable {
 *     // Geospatial index.
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField(index = true)
 *     private com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Point location;
 *
 *     // Not indexed field.
 *     &#64;QuerySqlField
 *     private String name;
 *
 *     public MapPoint(com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Point location, String name) {
 *         this.location = location;
 *         this.name = name;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * Example of spatial query on the geo-indexed field from above:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.GeometryFactory factory = new com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.GeometryFactory();
 *
 * com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Polygon square = factory.createPolygon(new Coordinate[] {
 *     new com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Coordinate(0, 0),
 *     new com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Coordinate(0, 100),
 *     new com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Coordinate(100, 100),
 *     new com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Coordinate(100, 0),
 *     new com.vividsolutions.jts.geom.Coordinate(0, 0)
 * });
 *
 * Map.Entry<String, UserData> records = cache.queries().createSqlQuery(MapPoint.class, "select * from MapPoint where location && ?")
 *     .queryArguments(square)
 *     .execute()
 *     .get();
 * </pre>
