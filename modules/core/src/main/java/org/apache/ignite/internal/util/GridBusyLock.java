 * For example, there may be a manager that have different threads for some
 * purposes and the manager must not be stopped while at least a single thread
 * is in "busy" state. In this situation each thread must enter to "busy"
 * state calling method {@link #enterBusy()} in critical pieces of code

 * and the whole grid kernal cannot be stopped while it's in progress. Once
 * the activity is done, the thread should leave "busy" state calling method
 * {@link #leaveBusy()}. The manager itself, when stopping, should call method
 * {@link #block} that blocks till all activities leave "busy" state.
