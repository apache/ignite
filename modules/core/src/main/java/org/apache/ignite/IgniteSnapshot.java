 * <li>Snapshot will be taken from all registered persistence caches to
 * grantee data consistency between them.</li>
 * <li>Snapshot must be resorted manually on the switched off cluster by copying data
 * to the working directory on each cluster node.</li>
 * <li>Concurrent updates from {@link IgniteDataStreamer} with default {@link IgniteDataStreamer#allowOverwrite()}
 * setting (false) into a persistent cache can cause that cache data stored inconsistent.</li>
