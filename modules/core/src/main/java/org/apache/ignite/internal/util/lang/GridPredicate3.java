/**
 * Defines predicate construct. Predicate like closure is a first-class function
 * that is defined with (or closed over) its free variables that are bound to the closure
 * scope at execution.
 * <p>
 * This form of predicate is essentially a syntactic "sugar" providing shorter syntax for:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * ...
 * GridPredicate&lt;GridTuple3&lt;E1, E2, E3&gt;&gt;
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * <h2 class="header">Type Alias</h2>
 * To provide for more terse code you can use a typedef {@link P3} class or various factory methods in
 * {@link GridFunc} class. Note, however, that since typedefs in Java rely on inheritance you should
 * not use these type aliases in signatures.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Note that this interface does not impose or assume any specific thread-safety by its
 * implementations. Each implementation can elect what type of thread-safety it provides,
 * if any.
 * @param <E1> Type of the first free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called on.
 * @param <E2> Type of the second free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called on.
 * @param <E3> Type of the third free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called on.
 * @see P3
 * @see GridFunc
