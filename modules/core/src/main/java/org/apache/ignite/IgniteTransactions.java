/**
 * Transactions facade provides ACID-compliant semantic when working with caches. You can
 * create a transaction when working with one cache or across multiple caches. Caches with
 * different cache modes, like {@link CacheMode#PARTITIONED PARTITIONED} or
 * {@link CacheMode#REPLICATED REPLICATED}, can also participate in the same transaction.
 * <p>
 * Transactions are {@link AutoCloseable}, so they will automatically rollback unless
 * explicitly committed.
 * <p>
 * Here is an example of a transaction:
 * <pre class="brush:java">
 * try (Transaction tx = Ignition.ignite().transactions().txStart()) {
 *   Account acct = cache.get(acctId);
 *
 *   // Current balance.
 *   double balance = acct.getBalance();
 *
 *   // Deposit $100 into account.
 *   acct.setBalance(balance + 100);
 *
 *   // Store updated account in cache.
 *   cache.put(acctId, acct);
 *
 *   tx.commit();
 * }
 * </pre>
