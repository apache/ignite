/**
 * {@link MaintenanceRegistry} is a service local to each Ignite node
 * that allows to request performing maintenance actions on that particular node.
 *
 * <p>
 *     When a node gets into a situation when some specific actions are required
 *     it enters the special mode called maintenance mode.
 *     In maintenance mode it doesn't join to the rest of the cluster but still allows to connect to it
 *     with control.{sh|bat} script or via JXM interface and perform needed actions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 *     Implementing new task for maintenance mode requires several pieces of code.
 *
 *     <ul>
 *         <li>
 *             First, component requiring Maintenance Mode should be able to register new {@link MaintenanceTask}
 *             with {@link MaintenanceRegistry#registerMaintenanceTask(MaintenanceTask)} method.
 *
 *             Registration could happen automatically (e.g. if component detects some emergency situation
 *             that requires user intervention)
 *             or by user request (e.g. for a planned maintenance that requires
 *             detaching node from the rest of the cluster).
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             Component responsible for handling this {@link MaintenanceTask}
 *             on startup checks if the task is registered (thus it should go to Maintenance Mode).
 *             If task is found component provides to {@link MaintenanceRegistry} its own implementation
 *             of {@link MaintenanceWorkflowCallback} interface
 *             via method {@link MaintenanceRegistry#registerWorkflowCallback(String, MaintenanceWorkflowCallback)}.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             {@link MaintenanceWorkflowCallback} should provide {@link MaintenanceRegistry} with
 *             {@link MaintenanceAction}s that are able to resolve maintenance task,
 *             get information about it and so on.
 *             Logic of these actions is completely up to the component providing it
 *             and depends only on particular maintenance task.
 *         </li>
 *         <li>
 *             When maintenance task is fixed, it should be removed from {@link MaintenanceRegistry}
 *             with call {@link MaintenanceRegistry#unregisterMaintenanceTask(String)}.
 *         </li>
 *     </ul>
