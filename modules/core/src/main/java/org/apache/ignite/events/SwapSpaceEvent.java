/**
 * Grid swap space event.
 * <p>
 * Grid events are used for notification about what happens within the grid. Note that by
 * design Ignite keeps all events generated on the local node locally and it provides
 * APIs for performing a distributed queries across multiple nodes:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteEvents#remoteQuery(org.apache.ignite.lang.IgnitePredicate, long, int...)} -
 *          asynchronously querying events occurred on the nodes specified, including remote nodes.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteEvents#localQuery(org.apache.ignite.lang.IgnitePredicate, int...)} -
 *          querying only local events stored on this local node.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteEvents#localListen(org.apache.ignite.lang.IgnitePredicate, int...)} -
 *          listening to local grid events (events from remote nodes not included).
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * User can also wait for events using method {@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteEvents#waitForLocal(org.apache.ignite.lang.IgnitePredicate, int...)}.
 * <h1 class="header">Events and Performance</h1>
 * Note that by default all events in Ignite are enabled and therefore generated and stored
 * by whatever event storage SPI is configured. Ignite can and often does generate thousands events per seconds
 * under the load and therefore it creates a significant additional load on the system. If these events are
 * not needed by the application this load is unnecessary and leads to significant performance degradation.
 * <p>
 * It is <b>highly recommended</b> to enable only those events that your application logic requires
 * by using {@link org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration#getIncludeEventTypes()} method in Ignite configuration. Note that certain
 * events are required for Ignite's internal operations and such events will still be generated but not stored by
 * event storage SPI if they are disabled in Ignite configuration.
