/**
 * API for configuring continuous cache queries.
 * <p>
 * Continuous queries allow to register a remote filter and a local listener
 * for cache updates. If an update event passes the filter, it will be sent to
 * the node that executed the query and local listener will be notified.
 * <p>
 * Additionally, you can execute initial query to get currently existing data.
 * Query can be of any type (SQL, TEXT or SCAN) and can be set via {@link #setInitialQuery(Query)}
 * method.
 * <p>
 * Query can be executed either on all nodes in topology using {@link IgniteCache#query(Query)}
 * method, or only on the local node, if {@link Query#setLocal(boolean)} parameter is set to {@code true}.
 * Note that in case query is distributed and a new node joins, it will get the remote
 * filter for the query during discovery process before it actually joins topology,
 * so no updates will be missed.
 * <h1 class="header">Example</h1>
 * As an example, suppose we have cache with {@code 'Person'} objects and we need
 * to query all persons with salary above 1000.
 * <p>
 * Here is the {@code Person} class:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class Person {
 *     // Name.
 *     private String name;
 *
 *     // Salary.
 *     private double salary;
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You can create and execute continuous query like so:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * // Create new continuous query.
 * ContinuousQuery&lt;Long, Person&gt; qry = new ContinuousQuery&lt;&gt;();
 *
 * // Initial iteration query will return all persons with salary above 1000.
 * qry.setInitialQuery(new ScanQuery&lt;&gt;((id, p) -> p.getSalary() &gt; 1000));
 *
 *
 * // Callback that is called locally when update notifications are received.
 * // It simply prints out information about all created persons.
 * qry.setLocalListener((evts) -> {
 *     for (CacheEntryEvent&lt;? extends Long, ? extends Person&gt; e : evts) {
 *         Person p = e.getValue();
 *
 *         System.out.println(p.getFirstName() + " " + p.getLastName() + "'s salary is " + p.getSalary());
 *     }
 * });
 *
 * // Continuous listener will be notified for persons with salary above 1000.
 * qry.setRemoteFilter(evt -> evt.getValue().getSalary() &gt; 1000);
 *
 * // Execute query and get cursor that iterates through initial data.
 * QueryCursor&lt;Cache.Entry&lt;Long, Person&gt;&gt; cur = cache.query(qry);
 * </pre>
 * This will execute query on all nodes that have cache you are working with and
 * listener will start to receive notifications for cache updates.
 * <p>
 * To stop receiving updates call {@link QueryCursor#close()} method:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * cur.close();
 * </pre>
 * Note that this works even if you didn't provide initial query. Cursor will
 * be empty in this case, but it will still unregister listeners when {@link QueryCursor#close()}
 * is called.
 * <p>
 * {@link IgniteAsyncCallback} annotation is supported for {@link CacheEntryEventFilter}
 * (see {@link #setRemoteFilterFactory(Factory)}) and {@link CacheEntryUpdatedListener}
 * (see {@link #setLocalListener(CacheEntryUpdatedListener)}).
 * If filter and/or listener are annotated with {@link IgniteAsyncCallback} then annotated callback
 * is executed in async callback pool (see {@link IgniteConfiguration#getAsyncCallbackPoolSize()})
 * and notification order is kept the same as update order for given cache key.
 *
