/**
 * Pluggable cache eviction policy. Usually, implementations will internally order
 * cache entries based on {@link #onEntryAccessed(boolean, EvictableEntry)} notifications and
 * whenever an element needs to be evicted, {@link EvictableEntry#evict()}
 * method should be called.
 * <p>
 * Ignite comes with following eviction policies out-of-the-box:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link LruEvictionPolicy}</li>
 * <li>{@link FifoEvictionPolicy}</li>
 * <li>{@link SortedEvictionPolicy}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The eviction policy thread-safety is ensured by Ignition. Implementations of this interface should
 * not worry about concurrency and should be implemented as they were only accessed from one thread.
 * <p>
 * Note that implementations of all eviction policies provided by Ignite are very
 * light weight in a way that they are all lock-free (or very close to it), and do not
 * create any internal tables, arrays, or other expensive structures.
 * The eviction order is preserved by attaching light-weight meta-data to existing
 * cache entries.
