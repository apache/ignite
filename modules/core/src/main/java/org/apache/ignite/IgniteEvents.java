/**
 * Provides functionality for local and remote event notifications on nodes defined by {@link #clusterGroup()}.
 * There are {@code 2} ways to subscribe to event listening, {@code local} and {@code remote}.
 * <p>
 * Instance of {@code IgniteEvents} is obtained from {@link Ignite} as follows:
 * <pre class="brush:java">
 * Ignite ignite = Ignition.ignite();
 *
 * IgniteEvents evts = ignite.events();
 * </pre>
 * You can also obtain an instance of the events facade over a specific cluster group:
 * <pre class="brush:java">
 * // Cluster group over remote nodes (excluding the local node).
 * ClusterGroup remoteNodes = ignite.cluster().forRemotes();
 *
 * // Events instance spanning all remote cluster nodes.
 * IgniteEvents evts = ignite.events(remoteNodes);
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * Local subscription, defined by {@link #localListen(IgnitePredicate, int...)} method, will add
 * a listener for specified events on local node only. This listener will be notified whenever any
 * of subscribed events happen on local node regardless of whether local node belongs to underlying
 * cluster group or not.
 * <p>
 * Remote subscription, defined by {@link #remoteListen(IgniteBiPredicate, IgnitePredicate, int...)}, will add an
 * event listener for specified events on all nodes in the cluster group (possibly including local node if
 * it belongs to the cluster group as well). All cluster group nodes will then be notified of the subscribed events.
 * If the events pass the remote event filter, the events will be sent to local node for local listener notification.
 * <p>
 * Note that by default, all events in Ignite are disabled for performance reasons. You must only enable
 * events that you need within your logic. You can enable/disable events either by calling {@link #enableLocal(int...)}
 * or {@link #disableLocal(int...)} methods, or from XML configuration.
 * For example, you can enable all cache events as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="xml">
 * &lt;property name="includeEventTypes"&gt;
 *     &lt;util:constant static-field="org.apache.ignite.events.IgniteEventType.EVTS_CACHE"/&gt;
 * &lt;/property&gt;
 * </pre>
