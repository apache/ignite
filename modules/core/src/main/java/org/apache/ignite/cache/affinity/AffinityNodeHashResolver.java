/**
 * Resolver which is used to provide node hash value for affinity function.
 * <p>
 * Node IDs constantly change when nodes get restarted, which causes affinity mapping to change between restarts,
 * and hence causing redundant repartitioning. Providing an alternate node hash value, which survives node restarts,
 * will help to map keys to the same nodes whenever possible.
 * <p>
 * Note that on case clients exist they will query this object from the server and use it for affinity calculation.
 * Therefore you must ensure that server and clients can marshal and unmarshal this object in binary format,
 * i.e. all parties have object class(es) configured as binary.
 *
 * @deprecated Use {@link IgniteConfiguration#setConsistentId(Serializable)} instead.
