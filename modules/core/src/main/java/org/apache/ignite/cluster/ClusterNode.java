/**
 * Interface representing a single cluster node. Use {@link #attribute(String)} or
 * {@link #metrics()} to get static and dynamic information about cluster nodes.
 * {@code ClusterNode} list, which includes all nodes within task topology, is provided
 * to {@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeTask#map(List, Object)} method.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Cluster Node Attributes</h1>
 * You can use cluster node attributes to provide static information about a node.
 * This information is initialized once within a cluster, during the node startup, and
 * remains the same throughout the lifetime of a node. Use
 * {@link IgniteConfiguration#getUserAttributes()} method to initialize your custom
 * node attributes at startup. Here is an example of how to assign an attribute to a node at startup:
 * <pre name="code" class="xml">
 * &lt;bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration">
 *     ...
 *     &lt;property name="userAttributes">
 *         &lt;map>
 *             &lt;entry key="worker" value="true"/>
 *         &lt;/map>
 *     &lt;/property>
 *     ...
 * &lt;/bean&gt;
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * The system adds the following attributes automatically:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code {@link System#getProperties()}} - All system properties.</li>
 * <li>{@code {@link System#getenv(String)}} - All environment properties.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.ignite.build.ver} - Ignite build version.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.apache.ignite.jit.name} - Name of JIT compiler used.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.apache.ignite.net.itf.name} - Name of network interface.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.apache.ignite.user.name} - Operating system user name.</li>
 * <li>{@code org.apache.ignite.ignite.name} - Ignite name (see {@link Ignite#name()}).</li>
 * <li>
 *      {@code spiName.org.apache.ignite.spi.class} - SPI implementation class for every SPI,
 *      where {@code spiName} is the name of the SPI (see {@link org.apache.ignite.spi.IgniteSpi#getName()}.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      {@code spiName.org.apache.ignite.spi.ver} - SPI version for every SPI,
 *      where {@code spiName} is the name of the SPI (see {@link org.apache.ignite.spi.IgniteSpi#getName()}.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that all System and Environment properties for all nodes are automatically included
 * into node attributes. This gives you an ability to get any information specified
 * in {@link System#getProperties()} about any node. So for example, in order to print out
 * information about Operating System for all nodes you would do the following:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * for (ClusterNode node : ignite.cluster().nodes()) {
 *     System.out.println("Operating system name: " + node.getAttribute("os.name"));
 *     System.out.println("Operating system architecture: " + node.getAttribute("os.arch"));
 *     System.out.println("Operating system version: " + node.getAttribute("os.version"));
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Cluster Node Metrics</h1>
 * Cluster node metrics (see {@link #metrics()}) are updated frequently for all nodes
 * and can be used to get dynamic information about a node. The frequency of update
 * is controlled by  {@link org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration#getMetricsUpdateFrequency()} parameter.
 * The metrics data will be updated every {@code 2} seconds by default.
 * <p>
 * Grid node metrics provide information that can frequently change,
 * such as Heap and Non-Heap memory utilization, CPU load, number of active and waiting
 * grid jobs, etc... This information can become useful during job collision resolution or
 * {@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeTask#map(List, Object)} operation when jobs are
 * assigned to remote nodes for execution.
 * <p>
 * Local node metrics are registered as {@code MBean} and can be accessed from
 * any JMX management console. The simplest way is to use standard {@code jconsole}
 * that comes with JDK as it also provides ability to view any node parameter
 * as a graph.
