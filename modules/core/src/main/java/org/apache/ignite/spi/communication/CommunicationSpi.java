/**
 * Communication SPI is responsible for data exchange between nodes.
 * <p>
 * Communication SPI is one of the most important SPI in Ignite. It is used
 * heavily throughout the system and provides means for all data exchanges
 * between nodes, such as internal implementation details and user driven
 * messages.
 * <p>
 * Functionality to this SPI is exposed directly in {@link org.apache.ignite.Ignite} interface:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteMessaging#send(Object, Object)}
 *      <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteMessaging#send(Object, Collection)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Ignite comes with built-in communication SPI implementations:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.spi.communication.tcp.TcpCommunicationSpi}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> this SPI (i.e. methods in this interface) should never be used directly. SPIs provide
 * internal view on the subsystem and is used internally by Ignite kernal. In rare use cases when
 * access to a specific implementation of this SPI is required - an instance of this SPI can be obtained
 * via {@link org.apache.ignite.Ignite#configuration()} method to check its configuration properties or call other non-SPI
 * methods. Note again that calling methods from this interface on the obtained instance can lead
 * to undefined behavior and explicitly not supported.
