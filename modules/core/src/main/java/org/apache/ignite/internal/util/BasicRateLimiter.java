/**
 * The simplified version of Google Guava smooth rate limiter.<br><br>
 *
 * The primary feature of a rate limiter is its "stable rate", the maximum rate that is should
 * allow at normal conditions. This is enforced by "throttling" incoming requests as needed, i.e.
 * compute, for an incoming request, the appropriate throttle time, and make the calling thread
 * wait as much.<br><br>
 *
 * The simplest way to maintain a rate of QPS is to keep the timestamp of the last granted
 * request, and ensure that (1/QPS) seconds have elapsed since then. For example, for a rate of
 * QPS=5 (5 tokens per second), if we ensure that a request isn't granted earlier than 200ms after
 * the last one, then we achieve the intended rate. If a request comes and the last request was
 * granted only 100ms ago, then we wait for another 100ms. At this rate, serving 15 fresh permits
 * (i.e. for an acquire(15) request) naturally takes 3 seconds.<br><br>
 *
 * It is important to realize that such a limiter has a very superficial memory of the past:
 * it only remembers the last request. if the limiter was unused for a long period of
 * time, then a request arrived and was immediately granted? This limiter would immediately
 * forget about that past underutilization.
