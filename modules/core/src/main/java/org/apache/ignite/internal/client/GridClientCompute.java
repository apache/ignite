/**
 * A compute projection of grid client. Contains various methods for task execution, full and partial (per node)
 * topology refresh, and log viewing. An initial instance of compute projection over the whole remote grid is
 * provided via {@link GridClient#compute()} method. Further sub-projections may be created via
 * any of the {@code projection(...)} methods on this API.
 * <p>
 * You can create custom client projections based on any user-defined filtering. For example you can create
 * a projection over a certain group of nodes, or over all nodes that have a certain attribute. Once projection
 * is created, only nodes that belong to this projection will be contacted on remote grid for any operation.
 * This essentially allows users to create virtual subgrids for remote task execution.
 * <p>
 * Use any of the {@code execute(...)} methods to execute tasks on remote grid. Note that tasks need
 * to be deployed to remote grid first prior to execution. You can also use any of the
 * {@code affinityExecute(...)} methods to execute tasks on node that have affinity with some data key.
 * This way you can collocate your computation with the data cached on remote nodes.
 * <p>
 * You can also use any of the {@code refreshNode(...)} or {@code refreshTopology(...)} methods
 * to eagerly refresh metrics or attributes on remote nodes (note that attributes are static,
 * so it is sufficient to fetch and cache them only once). Metrics and attributes will be
 * cached in {@link GridClientNode} instances automatically if {@link GridClientConfiguration#isEnableMetricsCache()}
 * or {@link GridClientConfiguration#isEnableAttributesCache()} property is set to {@code true}.
 * <p>
 * Compute client also allows fetching contents of remote log files (including backwards mode) via any of
 * the provided {@code log(...)} methods.
 * <h1 class="header">Affinity Awareness</h1>
 * One of the unique properties of the Ignite remote clients is that they are
 * affinity aware. In other words, both compute and data APIs will optionally
 * contact exactly the node where the data is cached based on some affinity key.
 * This allows for collocation of computations and data and avoids extra network
 * hops that would be necessary if non-affinity nodes were contacted. Use
 * {@link #affinityExecute(String, String, Object, Object)} and
 * {@link #affinityExecuteAsync(String, String, Object, Object)} to synchronously
 * or asynchronously execute remote tasks on affinity nodes based on provided
 * affinity keys.
