/**
 * Client node receives discovery messages in asynchronous mode
 * so it is possible that all server nodes already accepted new mapping but clients are unaware about it.
 *
 * In this case it is possible for client node to receive a request to perform some operation on such class
 * client doesn't know about its mapping.
 * Upon receiving such request client sends an explicit {@link MissingMappingRequestMessage} mapping request
 * to one of server nodes using CommunicationSPI and waits for {@link MissingMappingResponseMessage} response.
 *
 * If server node where mapping request was sent to leaves the cluster for some reason
 * mapping request gets automatically resent to the next alive server node in topology.
