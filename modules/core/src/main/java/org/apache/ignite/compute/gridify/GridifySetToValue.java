/**
 * {@code GridifySetToValue} annotation is the way to grid-enable existing code with specific semantics.
 * <p>
 * This annotation can be applied to any public method that needs to be grid-enabled,
 * static or non-static. When this annotation is applied to a method, the method
 * execution is considered to be grid-enabled. In general, the execution of this
 * method can be transferred to another node in the grid, potentially splitting it
 * into multiple subtasks to be executed in parallel on multiple grid nodes. But
 * from the caller perspective this method still looks and behaves like a local apply.
 * This is achieved by utilizing AOP-based interception of the annotated code and
 * injecting all the necessary grid logic into the method execution.
 * <p>
 * {@code GridifySetToValue} used as extended version of {@code Gridify} annotation.
 * It provides automated gridification of two popular types of mathematical
 * functions that allow for "embarrassingly" simple parallelization (for example,
 * find prime numbers in collection or find maximum in collection). The goal of this
 * addition is to provide very simple and easy to use real ForkJoin gridification
 * for some often used use cases. Note that in a standard {@code Gridify} annotation
 * the user has to write {@link org.apache.ignite.compute.ComputeTask} to provide ForkJoin behavior.
 * In a proposed design - the ForkJoin will be achieved automatically.
 * <p>
 * Let <b>F</b> be the function or a method in Java language and <b>St</b> be a set of values
 * of type {@code t} or a typed Collection&lt;T&gt; in Java. Let also {@code R} be
 * the result value. These are the types of functions that will be supported (defined in
 * terms of their properties):
 * <p>
 * F (S 1, S 2, ..., S k) => R, where F (S 1, S 2, ..., S k) == F (F (S 1), F (S 2), ..., F (S k))
 * which basically defines a function over a set that produces the same result when applied
 * recursively over its results for a subsets of the original set.
 * <p>
 * In definition above we used Collection&lt;T&gt; for the purpose of example.
 * The following Java collections will have to be supported as return values or method parameters:
 * <ul>
 * <li>java.util.Collection</li>
 * <li>java.util.Iterator</li>
 * <li>java.util.Enumeration</li>
 * <li>java.lang.CharSequence</li>
 * <li>java array</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Note that when using {@code @GridifySetToValue} annotation the state of the whole instance will be
 * serialized and sent out to remote node. Therefore the class must implement
 * {@link Serializable} interface. If you cannot make the class {@code Serializable},
 * then you must implement custom grid task which will take care of proper state
 * initialization. In either case, Ignite must be able to serialize the state passed to remote node.
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Java Example</h1>
 * <p>
 * Example for these types of functions would be any aggregate function returning single value from
 * the multiple inputs. For example:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * ...
 * &#64;GridifySetToValue(threshold = 2)
 * public static Number findMaxValue(Collection&lt;Number&gt; input);
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * Method {@code findMaxValue}findMaxValue simply traverses the input collection and finds
 * the maximum element in. If we split this collection into two sub-collections, for example,
 * and find maximums in each - we can then apply the same method to the collection of two just
 * found maximums to find the overall maximum elements of the original collection.
 * The formal definition of (or requirement for) such method:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Have return value of type <b>T</b></li>
 * <li>Have one and only one parameter of type <b>Collection&lt;T&gt;</b></li>
 * <li>Order of <b>Collection&lt;T&gt;</b> parameter is irrelevant</li>
 * <li>Method can have as many other parameters as needed of any type except for <b>Collection&lt;T&gt;</b></li>
 * <li>Logic of the method must allow for recursive apply on the subset of the original collection</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Jboss AOP</h1>
 * The following configuration needs to be applied to enable JBoss byte code
 * weaving. Note that Ignite is not shipped with JBoss and necessary
 * libraries will have to be downloaded separately (they come standard
 * if you have JBoss installed already):
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      The following JVM configuration must be present:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@code -javaagent:[path to jboss-aop-jdk50-4.x.x.jar]}</li>
 *      <li>{@code -Djboss.aop.class.path=[path to ignite.jar]}</li>
 *      <li>{@code -Djboss.aop.exclude=org,com -Djboss.aop.include=org.apache.ignite.examples}</li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      The following JARs should be in a classpath:
 *      <ul>
 *      <li>{@code javassist-3.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code jboss-aop-jdk50-4.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code jboss-aspect-library-jdk50-4.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code jboss-common-4.x.x.jar}</li>
 *      <li>{@code trove-1.0.2.jar}</li>
 *      </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">AspectJ AOP</h1>
 * The following configuration needs to be applied to enable AspectJ byte code
 * weaving.
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      JVM configuration should include:
 *      {@code -javaagent:${IGNITE_HOME}/libs/aspectjweaver-1.7.2.jar}
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      META-INF/aop.xml file should be created and specified on the classpath.
 *      The file should contain Gridify aspects and needed weaver options.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * <h1 class="header">Spring AOP</h1>
 * Spring AOP framework is based on dynamic proxy implementation and doesn't require
 * any specific runtime parameters for online weaving. All weaving is on-demand and should
 * be performed by calling method
 * {@ignitelink org.apache.ignite.compute.gridify.aop.spring.GridifySpringEnhancer#enhance(java.lang.Object)} for the object
 * that has method with {@link GridifySetToValue} annotation.
 * <p>
 * Note that this method of weaving is rather inconvenient and AspectJ or JBoss AOP is
 * recommended over it. Spring AOP can be used in situation when code augmentation is
 * undesired and cannot be used. It also allows for very fine grained control of what gets
 * weaved.
