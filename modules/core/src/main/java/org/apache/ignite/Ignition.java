/**
 * This class defines a factory for the main Ignite API. It controls Grid life cycle
 * and allows listening for grid events.
 * <h1 class="header">Grid Loaders</h1>
 * Although user can apply grid factory directly to start and stop grid, grid is
 * often started and stopped by grid loaders. Grid loaders can be found in
 * {@link org.apache.ignite.startup} package, for example:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.startup.cmdline.CommandLineStartup}</li>
 * <li>{@ignitelink org.apache.ignite.startup.servlet.ServletStartup}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h1 class="header">Examples</h1>
 * Use {@link #start()} method to start grid with default configuration. You can also use
 * {@link org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration} to override some default configuration. Below is an
 * example on how to start grid with custom configuration for <strong>URI deployment</strong>.
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * IgniteConfiguration cfg = new IgniteConfiguration();
 *
 * GridUriDeployment deploySpi = new GridUriDeployment();
 *
 * deploySpi.setUriList(Collections.singletonList("classes://tmp/output/classes"));
 *
 * cfg.setDeploymentSpi(deploySpi);
 *
 * Ignition.start(cfg);
 * </pre>
 * Here is how a grid instance can be configured from Spring XML configuration file. The
 * example below configures a grid instance with additional user attributes
 * (see {@link org.apache.ignite.cluster.ClusterNode#attributes()}) and specifies a grid name:
 * <pre name="code" class="xml">
 * &lt;bean id="grid.cfg" class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration"&gt;
 *     ...
 *     &lt;property name="gridName" value="grid"/&gt;
 *     &lt;property name="userAttributes"&gt;
 *         &lt;map&gt;
 *             &lt;entry key="group" value="worker"/&gt;
 *         &lt;/map&gt;
 *     &lt;/property&gt;
 *     ...
 * &lt;/bean&gt;
 * </pre>
 * A grid instance with Spring configuration above can be started as following. Note that
 * you do not need to pass path to Spring XML file if you are using
 * {@code IGNITE_HOME/config/default-config.xml}. Also note, that the path can be
 * absolute or relative to IGNITE_HOME.
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * ...
 * Ignition.start("/path/to/spring/xml/file.xml");
 * ...
 * </pre>
 * You can also instantiate grid directly from Spring without using {@code Ignition}.
 * For more information refer to {@ignitelink org.apache.ignite.IgniteSpringBean} documentation.
