/**
 * Data streamer is responsible for streaming external data into cache. It achieves it by
 * properly buffering updates and properly mapping keys to nodes responsible for the data
 * to make sure that there is the least amount of data movement possible and optimal
 * network and memory utilization.
 * <p>
 * Note that data streamer data manipulation methods do not support transactions.
 * When updating data with {@link #allowOverwrite()} set to {@code false} new entry
 * is created on primary and backups if it has not existed. If {@link #allowOverwrite()}
 * is {@code true} then batches are applied with regular {@code cache.put(..)} methods
 * starting implicit transactions if streamer is targeted to a transactional cache.
 * <p>
 * However, explicit transactional updates inside are possible with custom {@link StreamReceiver}.
 * This way batches can be applied within transaction(s) on target node.
 * See {@link #receiver(StreamReceiver)} for details.
 * <p>
 * Data streamer doesnâ€™t guarantee:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>Data order. Data records may be loaded into a cache in a different order compared to putting into the
 *  streamer;</li>
 *  <li>Immediate data loading. Data can be kept for a while before loading;</li>
 *  <li>By default, data consistency until successfully finished;</li>
 *  <li>By default, working with external storages.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * If {@link #allowOverwrite()} setting is {@code false} (default), consider:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>You should not have the same keys repeating in the data being streamed;</li>
 *  <li>Streamer cancelation or streamer node failure can cause data inconsistency;</li>
 *  <li>If loading into a persistent cache, concurrently created snapshot may contain inconsistent data and might not
 *  be restored entirely.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Most important behaviour of data streamer is defined by {@link StreamReceiver} and {@link #allowOverwrite()} property.
 * <p>
 * Also note that {@code IgniteDataStreamer} is not the only way to add data into cache.
 * Alternatively you can use {@link IgniteCache#loadCache(IgniteBiPredicate, Object...)}
 * method to add data from underlying data store. You can also use standard
 * cache {@code put(...)} and {@code putAll(...)} operations as well, but they most
 * likely will not perform as well as this class for adding data. And finally,
 * data can be added from underlying data store on demand, whenever it is accessed -
 * for this no explicit data adding step is needed.
 * <p>
 * {@code IgniteDataStreamer} supports the following configuration properties:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>
 *      {@link #perNodeBufferSize(int)} - when entries are added to data streamer via
 *      {@link #addData(Object, Object)} method, they are not sent to in-memory data grid right
 *      away and are buffered internally for better performance and network utilization.
 *      This setting controls the size of internal per-node buffer before buffered data
 *      is sent to remote node. Default is defined by {@link #DFLT_PER_NODE_BUFFER_SIZE}
 *      value.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      {@link #perNodeParallelOperations(int)} - sometimes data may be added
 *      to the data streamer via {@link #addData(Object, Object)} method faster than it can
 *      be put in cache. In this case, new buffered stream messages are sent to remote nodes
 *      before responses from previous ones are received. This could cause unlimited heap
 *      memory utilization growth on local and remote nodes. To control memory utilization,
 *      this setting limits maximum allowed number of parallel buffered stream messages that
 *      are being processed on remote nodes. If this number is exceeded, then
 *      {@link #addData(Object, Object)} method will block to control memory utilization.
 *      Default is equal to CPU count on remote node multiply by {@link #DFLT_PARALLEL_OPS_MULTIPLIER}.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      {@link #autoFlushFrequency(long)} - automatic flush frequency in milliseconds. Essentially,
 *      this is the time after which the streamer will make an attempt to submit all data
 *      added so far to remote nodes. Note that there is no guarantee that data will be
 *      delivered after this concrete attempt (e.g., it can fail when topology is
 *      changing), but it won't be lost anyway. Disabled by default (default value is {@code 0}).
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      {@link #allowOverwrite(boolean)} - Sets flag enabling overwriting existing values in cache.
 *      Data streamer will perform better if this flag is disabled, which is the default setting.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      {@link #receiver(StreamReceiver)} - defines how cache will be updated with added entries.
 *      It allows to provide user-defined custom logic to update the cache in the most effective and flexible way.
 *  </li>
 *  <li>
 *      {@link #deployClass(Class)} - optional deploy class for peer deployment. All classes
 *      streamed by a data streamer must be class-loadable from the same class-loader.
 *      Ignite will make the best effort to detect the most suitable class-loader
 *      for data loading. However, in complex cases, where compound or deeply nested
 *      class-loaders are used, it is best to specify a deploy class which can be any
 *      class loaded by the class-loader for given data.
 *  </li>
 * </ul>
