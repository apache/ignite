/**
 * Type and field ID mapper for binary objects. Ignite never writes full
 * strings for field or type names. Instead, for performance reasons, Ignite
 * writes integer hash codes for type and field names. It has been tested that
 * hash code conflicts for the type names or the field names
 * within the same type are virtually non-existent and, to gain performance, it is safe
 * to work with hash codes. For the cases when hash codes for different types or fields
 * actually do collide {@code BinaryIdMapper} allows to override the automatically
 * generated hash code IDs for the type and field names.
 * <p>
 * Binary ID mapper can be configured for all binary objects via
 * {@link org.apache.ignite.configuration.BinaryConfiguration#getIdMapper()} method,
 * or for a specific binary type via {@link BinaryTypeConfiguration#getIdMapper()} method.
