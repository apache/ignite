/**
 * In-memory database (cache) rebalancing event. Rebalance event happens every time there is a change
 * in grid topology, which means that a node has either joined or left the grid.
 * <p>
 * Grid events are used for notification about what happens within the grid. Note that by
 * design Ignite keeps all events generated on the local node locally and it provides
 * APIs for performing a distributed queries across multiple nodes:
 * <ul>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link IgniteEvents#remoteQuery(IgnitePredicate, long, int...)} -
 *          asynchronously querying events occurred on the nodes specified, including remote nodes.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link IgniteEvents#localQuery(IgnitePredicate, int...)} -
 *          querying only local events stored on this local node.
 *      </li>
 *      <li>
 *          {@link IgniteEvents#localListen(IgnitePredicate, int...)} -
 *          listening to local grid events (events from remote nodes not included).
 *      </li>
 * </ul>
 * User can also wait for events using method {@link IgniteEvents#waitForLocal(IgnitePredicate, int...)}.
 * <h1 class="header">Events and Performance</h1>
 * Note that by default all events in Ignite are enabled and therefore generated and stored
 * by whatever event storage SPI is configured. Ignite can and often does generate thousands events per seconds
 * under the load and therefore it creates a significant additional load on the system. If these events are
 * not needed by the application this load is unnecessary and leads to significant performance degradation.
 * <p>
 * It is <b>highly recommended</b> to enable only those events that your application logic requires
 * by using {@link IgniteConfiguration#getIncludeEventTypes()} method in Ignite configuration. Note that certain
 * events are required for Ignite's internal operations and such events will still be generated but not stored by
 * event storage SPI if they are disabled in Ignite configuration.
