/**
 * Factory class for {@link LruEvictionPolicy}.
 *
 * Creates cache Eviction policy based on {@code Least Recently Used (LRU)} algorithm and supports batch eviction.
 * <p>
 * The eviction starts in the following cases:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The cache size becomes {@code batchSize} elements greater than the maximum size.</li>
 *     <li>
 *         The size of cache entries in bytes becomes greater than the maximum memory size.
 *         The size of cache entry calculates as sum of key size and value size.
 *     </li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>Note:</b>Batch eviction is enabled only if maximum memory limit isn't set ({@code maxMemSize == 0}).
 * {@code batchSize} elements will be evicted in this case. The default {@code batchSize} value is {@code 1}.

 *  {@link LruEvictionPolicy} implementation is very efficient since it is lock-free and does not create any additional table-like
 * data structures. The {@code LRU} ordering information is maintained by attaching ordering metadata to cache entries.
