/**
 * Defines a convenient {@code side-effect only} closure, i.e. the closure that has {@code void} return type.
 * Since Java 6 doesn't provide a language construct for first-class function the closures are
 * implemented as interfaces.
 * <h2 class="header">Type Alias</h2>
 * To provide for more terse code you can use a typedef {@link CI3} class or various factory methods in
 * {@link GridFunc} class. Note, however, that since typedefs in Java rely on inheritance you should
 * not use these type aliases in signatures.
 * <h2 class="header">Thread Safety</h2>
 * Note that this interface does not impose or assume any specific thread-safety by its
 * implementations. Each implementation can elect what type of thread-safety it provides,
 * if any.
 * @param <E1> Type of the first free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called or closed on.
 * @param <E2> Type of the second free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called or closed on.
 * @param <E3> Type of the third free variable, i.e. the element the closure is called or closed on.
