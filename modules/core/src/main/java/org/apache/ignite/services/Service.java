/**
 * An instance of grid-managed service. Grid-managed services may be deployed from
 * {@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteServices} facade or directly from grid configuration at startup.
 * <h1 class="header">Deployment</h1>
 * Whenever service is deployed, Ignite will automatically calculate how many
 * instances of this service should be deployed on each node within the cluster.
 * Whenever service is deployed on a cluster node, Ignite will call
 * {@link #execute(ServiceContext)} method on that service. It is up to the user
 * to control whenever the service should exit from the {@code execute} method.
 * For example, user may choose to implement service as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * public class MyIgniteService implements Service {
 *      ...
 *      // Example of ignite resource injection. All resources are optional.
 *      // You should inject resources only as needed.
 *      &#64;IgniteInstanceResource
 *      private Ignite ignite;
 *      ...
 *      &#64;Override public void cancel(ServiceContext ctx) {
 *          // No-op.
 *      }
 *
 *      &#64;Override public void execute(ServiceContext ctx) {
 *          // Loop until service is cancelled.
 *          while (!ctx.isCancelled()) {
 *              // Do something.
 *              ...
 *          }
 *      }
 *  }
 * </pre>
 * Consecutively, this service can be deployed as follows:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * ...
 * IgniteServices svcs = ignite.services();
 *
 * svcs.deployClusterSingleton("mySingleton", new MyIgniteService());
 * </pre>
 * Or from grid configuration on startup:
 * <pre name="code" class="java">
 * IgniteConfiguration gridCfg = new IgniteConfiguration();
 *
 * IgniteServiceConfiguration svcCfg = new IgniteServiceConfiguration();
 *
 * // Configuration for cluster-singleton service.
 * svcCfg.setName("mySingleton");
 * svcCfg.setMaxPerNodeCount(1);
 * svcCfg.setTotalCount(1);
 * svcCfg.setService(new MyIgniteService());
 *
 * gridCfg.setServiceConfiguration(svcCfg);
 * ...
 * Ignition.start(gridCfg);
 * </pre>
 * <h1 class="header">Cancellation</h1>
 * Services can be cancelled by calling any of the {@code cancel} methods on {@link org.apache.ignite.IgniteServices} API.
 * Whenever a deployed service is cancelled, Ignite will automatically call
 * {@link Service#cancel(ServiceContext)} method on that service.
 * <p>
 * Note that Ignite cannot guarantee that the service exits from {@link Service#execute(ServiceContext)}
 * method whenever {@link #cancel(ServiceContext)} is called. It is up to the user to
 * make sure that the service code properly reacts to cancellations.
