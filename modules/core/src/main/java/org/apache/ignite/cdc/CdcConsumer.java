/**
 * Consumer of WAL data change events.
 * This consumer will receive data change events during {@link CdcMain} application invocation.
 * The lifecycle of the consumer is the following:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Start of the consumer {@link #start()}.</li>
 *     <li>Notification of the consumer by the {@link #onEvents(Iterator)} call.</li>
 *     <li>Stop of the consumer {@link #stop()}.</li>

 * public class ChangeDataCaptureConsumer implements ChangeDataCaptureConsumer {
 *     &#64;LoggerResource
 *     private IgniteLogger log;
 *
 *     ...
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * Note, consumption of the {@link CdcEvent} will be started from the last saved offset.
 * The offset of consumptions is saved on the disk every time {@link #onEvents(Iterator)} returns {@code true}.
 *
 * @see CdcMain
 * @see CdcEvent
