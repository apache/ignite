/**
 * Represents request to handle maintenance situation.
 *
 * It can be created automatically or by user request by any component needed maintenance and should be registered
 * in Maintenance Registry with the method {@link MaintenanceRegistry#registerMaintenanceTask(MaintenanceTask)}.
 *
 * Lifecycle of Maintenance Task is managed by {@link MaintenanceRegistry}.
 *
 * Task contains unique ID of maintenance situation (e.g. situation of PDS corruption or defragmentation),
 * description of task and optional parameters.
 *
 * When task is created node should be restarted to enter maintenance mode.
 * In that mode node can start actions needed to resolve maintenance situation or wait for user to trigger them.
 *
 * Components that may need to perform maintenance actions as part of their recovery workflow should check
 * maintenance status on startup and supply {@link MaintenanceWorkflowCallback} implementation to
 * {@link MaintenanceRegistry#registerWorkflowCallback(String, MaintenanceWorkflowCallback)} to allow Maintenance Registry
 * to find maintenance actions and start them automatically or by user request.
 *
 * Matching between {@link MaintenanceTask} and {@link MaintenanceWorkflowCallback} is performed based on
 * the name of maintenance task that should be unique among all registered tasks.
