/**
 * Grid discovery SPI allows to discover remote nodes in grid.
 * <p>
 * The default discovery SPI is {@link org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.TcpDiscoverySpi}
 * with default configuration which allows all nodes in local network
 * (with enabled multicast) to discover each other.
 * <p>
 * Ignite provides the following {@code GridDeploymentSpi} implementation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.apache.ignite.spi.discovery.tcp.TcpDiscoverySpi}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> this SPI (i.e. methods in this interface) should never be used directly. SPIs provide
 * internal view on the subsystem and is used internally by Ignite kernal. In rare use cases when
 * access to a specific implementation of this SPI is required - an instance of this SPI can be obtained
 * via {@link org.apache.ignite.Ignite#configuration()} method to check its configuration properties or call other non-SPI
 * methods. Note again that calling methods from this interface on the obtained instance can lead
 * to undefined behavior and explicitly not supported.
