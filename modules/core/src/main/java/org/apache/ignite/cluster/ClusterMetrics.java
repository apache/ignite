/**
 * This class represents runtime information on a cluster. Apart from obvious
 * statistical value, this information is used for implementation of
 * load balancing, failover, and collision SPIs. For example, collision SPI
 * in combination with fail-over SPI could check if other nodes don't have
 * any active or waiting jobs and fail-over some jobs to those nodes.
 * <p>
 * Node metrics for any node can be accessed via {@link ClusterNode#metrics()}
 * method. Keep in mind that there will be a certain network delay (usually
 * equal to metrics update delay) for the accuracy of node metrics. However, when accessing
 * metrics on local node {@link IgniteCluster#localNode() IgniteCluster.localNode().getMetrics()}
 * the metrics are always accurate and up to date.
 * <p>
 * Local node metrics are registered as {@code MBean} and can be accessed from
 * any JMX management console. The simplest way is to use standard {@code jconsole}
 * that comes with JDK as it also provides ability to view any node parameter
 * as a graph.
