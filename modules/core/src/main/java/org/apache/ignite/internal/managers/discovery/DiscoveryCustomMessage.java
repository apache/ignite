/**
 * <b>DiscoveryCustomMessage</b> messages are handled by discovery protocol which provides some guarantees around them.
 *
 * When some node sends <b>DiscoveryCustomMessage</b> with {@link GridDiscoveryManager#sendCustomEvent(DiscoveryCustomMessage)}
 * call, message firstly goes to current coordinator, is verified there and after that gets sent to the cluster.
 * Only after verification it is delivered to listeners on all nodes starting from coordinator.
 *
 * To register a listener {@link GridDiscoveryManager#setCustomEventListener(Class, CustomEventListener)} method is used.
 *
 * Discovery protocol guarantees include:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         All discovery messages are observed by all nodes in exactly the same order,
 *         it is guaranteed by handling them in single-threaded mode.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         New server node joining process in default implementation involves two passes of different messages across the cluster:
 *         {@link TcpDiscoveryNodeAddedMessage} and
 *         {@link TcpDiscoveryNodeAddFinishedMessage} messages.
 *         It is guaranteed that all discovery messages observed by coordinator in between these two messages
 *         are reordered and guaranteed to be delivered to newly joined node.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * Yet there are some features and limitations one should be aware of when using custom discovery messaging mechanism:
 * <ol>
 *     <li>
 *         Guarantee #2 doesn't encompass <b>DiscoveryCustomMessage</b>s created automatically on
 *         {@link DiscoveryCustomMessage#ackMessage()} method call.
 *
 *         If there were messages of this type in between <b>TcpDiscoveryNodeAddedMessage</b> and
 *         <b>TcpDiscoveryNodeAddFinishedMessage</b> messages, they won't be delivered to new joiner node.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         There is no guarantee for a given <b>DiscoveryCustomMessage</b> to be delivered only once.
 *         It is possible that because of node failure antecedent node will resend messages
 *         it thinks were not sent by failed node.
 *         Duplicate messages are not filtered out on receiver side.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         <b>DiscoveryCustomMessage</b>s are delivered to client nodes in asynchronous fashion
 *         as clients don't participate in the cluster ring.
 *     </li>
 *     <li>
 *         Any blocking operations like obtaining locks or doing I/O <b>must</b> be avoided in message handlers
 *         as they may lead to deadlocks and cluster failures.
 *     </li>
 * </ol>
