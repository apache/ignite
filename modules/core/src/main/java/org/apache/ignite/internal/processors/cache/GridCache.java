/**
 * Main entry point for all <b>Data Grid APIs.</b> You can get a named cache by calling {@link org.apache.ignite.Ignite#cache(String)}
 * method.
 * <h1 class="header">Functionality</h1>
 * This API extends {@link CacheProjection} API which contains vast majority of cache functionality
 * and documentation. In addition to {@link CacheProjection} functionality this API provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *  Various {@code 'loadCache(..)'} methods to load cache either synchronously or asynchronously.
 *  These methods don't specify any keys to load, and leave it to the underlying storage to load cache
 *  data based on the optionally passed in arguments.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *     Method {@link #affinity()} provides {@link AffinityFunction} service for information on
 *     data partitioning and mapping keys to grid nodes responsible for caching those keys.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *  Methods like {@code 'tx{Un}Synchronize(..)'} witch allow to get notifications for transaction state changes.
 *  This feature is very useful when integrating cache transactions with some other in-house transactions.
 * </li>
 * <li>Method {@link #metrics()} to provide metrics for the whole cache.</li>
 * <li>Method {@link #configuration()} to provide cache configuration bean.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * @param <K> Cache key type.
 * @param <V> Cache value type.
