/**
 * This annotation disables caching of task results when attached to {@link ComputeTask} class
 * being executed. Use it when number of jobs within task grows too big, or jobs themselves
 * are too large to keep in memory throughout task execution. By default all results are cached and passed into
 * {@link ComputeTask#result(ComputeJobResult,List) ComputeTask.result(ComputeJobResult, List&lt;ComputeJobResult&gt;)}
 * method or {@link ComputeTask#reduce(List) ComputeTask.reduce(List&lt;ComputeJobResult&gt;)} method.
 * When this annotation is attached to a task class, then this list of job results will always be empty.
 * <p>
 * Note that if this annotation is attached to a task class, then job siblings list is not maintained
 * and always has size of {@code 0}. This is done to make sure that in case if task emits large
 * number of jobs, list of jobs siblings does not grow. This only affects the following methods
 * on {@link ComputeTaskSession}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ComputeTaskSession#getJobSiblings()}</li>
 * <li>{@link ComputeTaskSession#getJobSibling(org.apache.ignite.lang.IgniteUuid)}</li>
 * <li>{@link ComputeTaskSession#refreshJobSiblings()}</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Use this annotation when job results are too large to hold in memory and can be discarded
 * after being processed in
 * {@link ComputeTask#result(ComputeJobResult, List) ComputeTask.result(ComputeJobResult, List&lt;ComputeJobResult&gt;)}
 * method.
