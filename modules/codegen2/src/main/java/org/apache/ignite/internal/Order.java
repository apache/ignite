/**
 * The annotation specifies the position of a field in the serialized and deserialized byte sequence of a {@code Message} class.
 * <p>
 * The {@code value} indicates the index of the field in the serialization order.
 * Fields annotated with {@code @Order} are processed in ascending order of their index.
 * <p> By default, it is assumed that getters and setters are named as the annotated fields,
 * e.g. field 'val' should have getters and satters with name 'val' (according Ignite's to code-style).
 * If you need to override this behavior, you can specify their name in the {@link #method} attribute.
 * <p> This annotation must be used on non-static fields, and access to those fields
 * should be performed strictly through corresponding getter and setter methods
 * following the naming convention: {@code fieldName()} for getter and {@code fieldName(Type)} for setter.
