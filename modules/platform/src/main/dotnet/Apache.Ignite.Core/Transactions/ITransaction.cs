    ///     <item>
    ///         <description><see cref="TransactionIsolation.READ_COMMITTED"/> isolation level 
    ///         means that always a committed value will be provided for read operations. With this isolation 
    ///         level values are always read from cache global memory or persistent store every time a value 
    ///         is accessed. In other words, if the same key is accessed more than once within the same transaction, 
    ///         it may have different value every time since global cache memory may be updated concurrently by 
    ///         other threads.</description>
    ///     </item>
    ///     <item>
    ///         <description><see cref="TransactionIsolation.REPEATABLE_READ"/> isolation level 
    ///         means that if a value was read once within transaction, then all consecutive reads will provide 
    ///         the same in-transaction value. With this isolation level accessed values are stored within 
    ///         in-transaction memory, so consecutive access to the same key within the same transaction will always 
    ///         return the value that was previously read or updated within this transaction. If concurrency is 
    ///         <see cref="TransactionConcurrency.PESSIMISTIC"/>, then a lock on the key will be 
    ///         acquired prior to accessing the value.</description>
    ///     </item>
    ///     <item>
    ///         <description><see cref="TransactionIsolation.SERIALIZABLE"/> isolation level means 
    ///         that all transactions occur in a completely isolated fashion, as if all transactions in the system 
    ///         had executed serially, one after the other. Read access with this level happens the same way as with 
    ///         <see cref="TransactionIsolation.REPEATABLE_READ"/> level. However, in 
    ///         <see cref="TransactionConcurrency.OPTIMISTIC"/> mode, if some transactions cannot be 
    ///         serially isolated from each other, then one winner will be picked and the other transactions in

    ///         operations 
    ///         are not distributed to other nodes until <see cref="ITransaction.Commit()"/>.
    ///         In this mode one <c>PREPARE</c> message will

    ///         without waiting for reply. If it is necessary to know whenever remote nodes have committed as well, 
    ///         synchronous commit or synchronous rollback should be enabled via 
    ///         <c>CacheConfiguration.setWriteSynchronizationMode</c>.
    ///         <para />
    ///         Note that in this mode, optimistic failures are only possible in conjunction with
    ///         <see cref="TransactionIsolation.SERIALIZABLE"/> isolation level. In all other cases, 
    ///         optimistic transactions will never fail optimistically and will always be identically ordered on all

    ///         <description><see cref="TransactionConcurrency.PESSIMISTIC"/> - in this mode a lock is 
    ///         acquired on all cache operations with exception of read operations in 
    ///         <see cref="TransactionIsolation.READ_COMMITTED"/> mode. All optional filters passed 
    ///         into cache operations will be evaluated after successful lock acquisition. Whenever 
    ///         <see cref="ITransaction.Commit()"/> is called, a single one-way <c>COMMIT</c> 
    ///         message is sent to participating cache nodes without waiting for reply. Note that there is no reason 
    ///         for distributed <c>PREPARE</c> step, as all locks have been already acquired. Just like with 
    ///         optimistic mode, it is possible to configure synchronous commit or rollback and wait till

    /// In addition to standard <c>CacheAtomicityMode.TRANSACTIONAL</c> behavior, GridGain also supports
    /// a lighter <c>CacheAtomicityMode.ATOMIC</c> mode as well. In this mode distributed transactions
    /// and distributed locking are not supported. Disabling transactions and locking allows to achieve much higher
    /// performance and throughput ratios. It is recommended that <c>CacheAtomicityMode.TRANSACTIONAL</c> mode
    /// is used whenever full <c>ACID</c>-compliant transactions are not needed.
    /// <example>
    ///     You can use cache transactions as follows:
    ///     <code>
    ///     ICacheTx tx = cache.TxStart();    
    /// 
    ///     try 
    ///     {
    ///         int v1 = cache&lt;string, int&gt;.Get("k1");
    ///         
    ///         // Check if v1 satisfies some condition before doing a put.
    ///         if (v1 > 0)
    ///             cache.Put&lt;string, int&gt;("k1", 2);
    ///             
    ///         cache.Removex("k2);
