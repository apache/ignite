Apache Ignite Control-Utility Module
------------------------

Apache Ignite control-utility module provides classes and configuration required for 'control.{sh|bat}' script execution.
To run the script make sure that folder 'ignite-control-utility' is presented in 'libs' folder (by default it is there).
If the folder is missing script cannot be used.
