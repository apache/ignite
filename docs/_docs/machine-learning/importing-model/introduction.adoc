= Introduction

Apache Ignite since 2.8 supports importing Machine Learning models from external platforms including Apache Spark ML and XGBoost. By working with imported models, you can:

- store imported models in Ignite for further inference,
- use imported models as part of pipelines,
- apply ensembling methods such as boosting, bagging, or stacking to those models.

Also, imported pre-trained models can be updated inside Apache Ignite.

Apache Ignite provides an API for distributed inference for models trained in [Apache Spark ML], [XGBoost], and [H2O].
