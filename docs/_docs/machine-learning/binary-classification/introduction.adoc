= Introduction

In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.

All existing training algorithms presented in this section are designed to solve binary classification tasks:


*  Linear SVM (Support Vector Machines)
*  Decision Trees
*    Multilayer perceptron
*    Logistic Regression
*    k-NN Classification
*    ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)
*    Naive Bayes


Binary or binomial classification is the task of classifying the elements of a given set into two groups (predicting which group each one belongs to) on the basis of a classification rule.
