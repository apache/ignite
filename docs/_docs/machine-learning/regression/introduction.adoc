= Introduction

Regression is a ML algorithm that can be trained to predict real numbered outputs, like temperature, stock price, etc. Regression is based on a hypothesis that can be linear, quadratic, polynomial, non-linear, etc. The hypothesis is a function that is based on some hidden parameters and the input values.

All existing training algorithms presented in this section are designed to solve regression tasks:

* Linear Regression
* Decision Trees Regression
* k-NN Regression
