= Ignite for .NET/C#

This chapter explains how to use .NET Core to build and run a simple Hello World example in .NET that starts a node, puts a value into the node and then gets the value.


== Prerequisites

Ignite.NET was officially tested on:

include::includes/dotnet-prerequisites.adoc[]


== Running a Simple .NET Example

[NOTE]
====
Ignite for .NET supports a thick client and a thin client. Because this guide focuses on the _thick_ client, you can run the example below after adding the Ignite library package. You do not need to download and install the Ignite distribution to run the example.

For information about the .NET thin client, see link:thin-clients/dotnet-thin-client[.NET Thin Client].
====

//TODO??: WARNING: If you use the thick client without downloading and installing Ignite distribution, some functionality (Logging, etc.) will be missing or not configured.

. Install .NET Core SDK (version 2+): https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

. Use the CLI (unix shell, Windows CMD or PowerShell, etc.) to run the following two commands:
+
`> dotnet new console`
+
This creates an empty project, which includes a project file with metadata and a .cs file with code.
+
And:
+
`> dotnet add package Apache.Ignite`
+
This modifies the project file - `.csproj` - to add dependencies.

. Open `Program.cs` in any text editor and replace the contents with the following:
+
[tabs]
--
tab:C#/.NET[]
[source,csharp]
----
using System;
using Apache.Ignite.Core;

namespace  IgniteTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
          var ignite = Ignition.Start();
          var cache = ignite.GetOrCreateCache<int, string>("my-cache");
          cache.Put(1, "Hello, World");
          Console.WriteLine(cache.Get(1));
        }
    }
}
----
--

. Save and then run the program:
+
`> dotnet run`

And that's it! You should see a node launch and then display "Hello, World".


== Next Steps

From here, you may want to:

* Check out the link:thin-clients/dotnet-thin-client[.NET thin client] that provides a lightweight form of connectivity
to Ignite clusters
* Explore the link:{githubUrl}/modules/platforms/dotnet/examples[additional examples] included with Ignite
* Refer to the link:net-specific[NET-specific section] of the documentation to learn more about capabilities
that are available for C# and .NET applications.
