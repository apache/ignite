= Ignite for Node.JS

This chapter explains system requirements for running Ignite, how to install Ignite, start a cluster and run a simple Hello World example using a thin client for Node.js.

Thin Client is a lightweight Ignite connection mode.
It does not participate in cluster, never holds any data, or performs computations.
All it does is establish a socket connection to an individual Ignite node and perform all operations through that node.

== Prerequisites

Ignite was tested on:

include::includes/prereqs.adoc[]

and:

[width="100%",cols="1,3"]
|=======================================================================
|Node.js |Version 8 or higher is required. Either download the Node.js pre-built binary for the target platform, or install Node.js via package manager.
|=======================================================================

== Installing Ignite

include::includes/install-ignite.adoc[]

Once that's done, execute the following command to install the Node.js Thin Client package:

include::includes/install-nodejs-npm.adoc[]

== Starting a Node

Before connecting to Ignite from Node.JS thin client, you must start at least one cluster node.

include::includes/starting-node.adoc[]

== Running Your First Application


Once the cluster is started, you can use the Ignite Node.js thin client to perform cache operations.
Your Ignite installation includes several ready-to-run Node.JS examples in the `{ignite_nodejs_dir}/platforms/nodejs/examples` directory. For example,

[source,shell]
----
cd {IGNITE_HOME}/platforms/nodejs/examples
node CachePutGetExample.js
----

Assuming that the server node is running locally, and that you have completed
all of the pre-requisites listed above, here is a very simple _HelloWorld_
example that puts and gets values from the cache. If you followed the
instructions above, and if you place this hello world example in your examples
folder, it should work.

[source,javascript]
----
const IgniteClient = require('apache-ignite-client');
const IgniteClientConfiguration = IgniteClient.IgniteClientConfiguration;
const ObjectType = IgniteClient.ObjectType;
const CacheEntry = IgniteClient.CacheEntry;

async function performCacheKeyValueOperations() {
    const igniteClient = new IgniteClient();
    try {
        await igniteClient.connect(new IgniteClientConfiguration('127.0.0.1:10800'));
        const cache = (await igniteClient.getOrCreateCache('myCache')).
            setKeyType(ObjectType.PRIMITIVE_TYPE.INTEGER);
        // put and get value
        await cache.put(1, 'Hello World');
        const value = await cache.get(1);
        console.log(value);

    }
    catch (err) {
        console.log(err.message);
    }
    finally {
        igniteClient.disconnect();
    }
}

performCacheKeyValueOperations();
----
