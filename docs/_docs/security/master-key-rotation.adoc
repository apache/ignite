= Master key rotation

== Overview

Master key encrypts cache keys. Encrypted cache keys are stored on the disk. To learn more see the link:security/tde[Transparent Data Encryption] page.

Ignite 2.9 introduces the master key change process. It allows users to switch Ignite to the new master key with re-encrypting cache keys.

Master key rotation is required if it has been compromised or at the end of the crypto period (key validity period).

== Prerequisites

A new master key should be available to `EncryptionSpi` for each server node. The cluster should be active.

== Configuration

Master keys are identified by name. When the cluster starts for the first time, the master key name from the configuration will be used. See link:security/tde#configuration[TDE Configuration].

Nodes save the master key name to the disk (local `MetaStorage`) on the first cluster activation and each master key change. If some node restarts, it will use the master key name from the local `MetaStorage`.

== Changing master key

NOTE: Cache start and node join during the key change process is prohibited and will be rejected.

Ignite provide the ability to change the master key from the following interfaces:

- link:#command-line-tool[command line tool]
- link:#jmx[JMX]
- link:#from-code[from code]

=== Command line tool

Ignite ships a `control.sh|bat` script, located in the `$IGNITE_HOME/bin` folder, that acts like a tool to manage the master key change process from the command line. The following commands can be used with `control.sh|bat`:

[source,shell]
----
# Print the current master key name.
control.sh|bat --encryption get_master_key_name

# Change the master key.
control.sh|bat --encryption change_master_key newMasterKeyName
----

=== JMX

You can also manage the master key change process via the `EncryptionMXBean` interface:

[cols="1,1",opts="header"]
|===
|Method | Description
|getMasterKeyName() | Gets the current master key name.
|changeMasterKey(String masterKeyName) | Starts master key change process.
|===

=== From code

The master key change process can be managed programmatically:

== Recovery of the master key on failing node

If some node is unavailable during a master key change process it won't be able to join to the cluster with the old master key. The node should re-encrypt local group keys during recovery on startup. The actual master key name should be set via `IGNITE_MASTER_KEY_NAME_TO_CHANGE_BEFORE_STARTUP` system property before the node starts. The node saves the key name to the local `MetaStorage` when the cluster is active.

NOTE: It is recommended to delete system property after a successful recovery. Otherwise, the invalid master key name can be used when the node restarts.

== Additional master key generation example

Ignite comes with the `KeystoreEncryptionSpi` based on JDK provided cipher algorithm implementations. See link:security/tde#master-key-generation-example[keystore master key generation example]. An additional master key can be generated using the `keytool` as follows:

[source,shell]
----
user:~/tmp:[]$ keytool \
-storepass mypassw0rd \
-storetype PKCS12 \
-keystore ./ignite_keystore.jks \
-list

Keystore type: PKCS12
Keystore provider: SunJSSE
