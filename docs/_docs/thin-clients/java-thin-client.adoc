= Java Thin Client

:sourceCodeFile: {javaCodeDir}/JavaThinClient.java
== Overview

The Java thin client is a lightweight client that connects to the cluster via a standard socket connection. It does not become a part of the cluster topology, never holds any data, and is not used as a destination for compute calculations. The thin client simply establishes a socket connection to a standard nodeâ€‹ and performs all operations through that node.

== Setting Up
If you use maven or gradle, add the `ignite-core` dependency to your application:


[tabs]
--
tab:Maven[]
[source,xml,subs="attributes,specialchars"]
----
<properties>
    <ignite.version>{version}</ignite.version>
</properties>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
        <artifactId>ignite-core</artifactId>
        <version>${ignite.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

tab:Gradle[]
[source,groovy,subs="attributes,specialchars"]
----
def igniteVersion = '{version}'

dependencies {
    compile group: 'org.apache.ignite', name: 'ignite-core', version: igniteVersion
}
----

--

Alternatively, you can use the `ignite-core-{version}.jar` library from the Ignite distribution package.

== Connecting to Cluster

To initialize a thin client, use the `Ignition.startClient(ClientConfiguration)` method. The method accepts a `ClientConfiguration` object, which defines client connection parameters.

The method returns the `IgniteClient` interface, which provides various methods for accessing data. `IgniteClient` is an auto-closable resource. Use the _try-with-resources_ statement to close the thin client and release the resources associated with the connection.

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=clientConnection,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can provide addresses of multiple nodes. In this case, the thin client randomly tries all the servers in the list and throws `ClientConnectionException` if none is available.

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=connect-to-many-nodes,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that the code above provides a failover mechanism in case of server node failures. Refer to the <<Handling Node Failures>> section for more information.

== Partition Awareness

== Using Key-Value API

The Java thin client supports most of the key-value operations available in the thick client.
To execute key-value operations on a specific cache, you need to get an instance of the cache and use one of its methods.

=== Getting a Cache Instance

The `ClientCache` interface provides the key-value API. You can use the following methods to obtain an instance of `ClientCache`:

* `IgniteClient.cache(String)`: assumes a cache with the specified name exists. The method does not communicate with the cluster to check if the cache really exists. Subsequent cache operations fail if the cache does not exist.
* `IgniteClient.getOrCreateCache(String)`, `IgniteClient.getOrCreateCache(ClientCacheConfiguration)`: get existing cache with the specified name or create the cache if it does not exist. The former operation creates a cache with default configuration.
* `IgniteClient.createCache(String)`, `IgniteClient.createCache(ClientCacheConfiguration)`: create a cache with the specified name and fail if the cache already exists.

Use `IgniteClient.cacheNames()` to list all existing caches.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Basic Cache Operations

The following code snippet demonstrates how to execute basic cache operations from the thin client.

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=key-value-operations,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=== Executing Scan Queries
Use the `ScanQuery<K, V>` class to get a set of entries that satisfy a given condition. The thin client sends the query to the cluster node where it is executed as a normal link:key-value-api/using-scan-queries[scan query].

The query condition is specified by an `IgniteBiPredicate<K, V>` object that is passed to the query constructor as an argument. The predicate is applied on the server side. If you don't provide any predicate, the query returns all cache entries.

NOTE: The classes of the predicates must be available on the server nodes of the cluster.

The results of the query are transferred to the client page by page. Each page contains a specific number of entries and is fetched to the client only when the entries from that page are requested. To change the number of entries in a page, use the `ScanQuery.setPageSize(int pageSize)` method (default value is 1024).

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=scan-query,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `IgniteClient.query(...)` method returns an instance of `FieldsQueryCursor`. Make sure to always close the cursor after you obtain all results.

=== Transactions

Client transactions are supported for caches with `AtomicityMode.TRANSACTIONAL` mode.

==== Executing Transactions

To start a transaction, obtain the `ClientTransactions` object from `IgniteClient`.
`ClientTransactions` has a number of  `txStart(...)` methods, each of which starts a new transaction and returns an object (`ClientTransaction`) that represents the transaction.
Use this object to commit or rollback the transaction.

[source, ruby]

==== Transaction Configuration

Client transactions can have different link:key-value-api/transactions#concurrency-modes-and-isolation-levels[concurrency modes, isolation levels], and execution timeout, which can be set for all transactions or on a per transaction basis.

The `ClientConfiguration` object supports setting the default concurrency mode, isolation level, and timeout for all transactions started with this client interface.


[source, java]
----
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tags=transaction-config,indent=0]

You can specify the concurrency mode, isolation level, and timeout when starting an individual transaction.
In this case, the provided values override the default settings.

=== Working with Binary Objects
The thin client fully supports Binary Object API described in the link:key-value-api/binary-objects[Working with Binary Objects] section.
Use `CacheClient.withKeepBinary()` to switch the cache to binary mode and start working directly with binary objects to avoid serialization/deserialization.
Use `IgniteClient.binary()` to get an instance of `IgniteBinary` and build an object from scratch.

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=binary-example,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to the link:key-value-api/binary-objects[Working with Binary Objects] page for detailed information.

== Executing SQL Statements

The Java thin client provides a SQL API to execute SQL statements. SQL statements are declared using the `SqlFieldsQuery` objects and executed through the `IgniteClient.query(SqlFieldsQuery)` method.

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=sql,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The `query(SqlFieldsQuery)` method returns an instance of `FieldsQueryCursor`, which can be used to iterate over the results. After getting the results, the cursor must be closed to release the resources associated with it.

NOTE: The `getAll()` method retrieves the results from the cursor and closes it.

Read more about using `SqlFieldsQuery` and SQL API in the link:SQL/sql-api[Using SQL API] section.

== Cluster API

Cluster functionality (APIs for accessing cluster and nodes) is provided via the `ClientCluster` interface. You can get an instance of `ClientCluster` from `IgniteClient` as follows:
[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=client-cluster,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through the `ClientCluster` interface you can:

* Get or set cluster state
* Get a list of all cluster members
* Create logical groups of nodes

=== Logical nodes grouping

API to create logical groups of nodes within your cluster is provided by `ClientClusterGroup` interface. Instance of this interface can be obtained from a parent `ClientClusterGroup` instance using node-filtering methods.

The `ClientCluster` instance it's a root cluster nodes group, which includes all nodes in the cluster.

Here is how you can use this API to get all server nodes in certain data-center (assuming node attribute "dc" is set to bind node and data-center):
[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=client-cluster-groups,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to link:distributed-computing/cluster-groups[Cluster groups] to get more information about logical nodes grouping.

== Executing compute tasks

The Java thin client has basic functionality to execute compute tasks. By default this feature is disabled on server-side. To enable this functionality server-side configuration property `maxActiveComputeTasksPerConnection` should be set explicitly to value more than 0:

[tabs]
--
tab:XML[]
[source,xml]
----
<bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration" id="ignite.cfg">
    <property name="clientConnectorConfiguration">
        <bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.ClientConnectorConfiguration">
            <property name="thinClientConfiguration">
                <bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.ThinClientConfiguration">
                    <property name="maxActiveComputeTasksPerConnection" value="100" />
                </bean>
            </property>
        </bean>
    </property>
</bean>

Compute tasks execution functionality provided by `ClientCompute` interface, which can be obtained from `IgniteClient` instance.

Currently, thin client only have an ability to run already deployed tasks by task name. To run some custom task users should deploy classes related to this task to the server manually.
[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=client-compute-task,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nodes set to execute compute tasks can be limited using cluster groups and corresponding `IgniteClient.compute(ClientClusterGroup)` method.

See link:distributed-computing/distributed-computing[distributed computing] for more information about compute grid functionality.

== Service invocation

The Java thin client is able to invoke grid-managed services. API for this functionality is provided by `ClientServices` interface, which can be obtained from `IgniteClient` instance.

Only already deployed to cluster services can be invoked, there is no functionality to deploy services by thin clients.
[source, java]

See link:service-grid/service-grid[Service Grid] for more information about grid-managed services.

== Handling Exceptions

=== Handling Node Failures

When you provide the addresses of multiple nodes in the client configuration, the client automatically switches to the next node if the current connection fails and retries any ongoing operation.

In the case of atomic operations, failover to another node is transparent to the user. However, if you execute a scan query or a SELECT query, iteration over query cursor may throw an `ClientConnectionException`. This can happen because queries return data in pages, and if the node that the client is connected to goes down while the client retrieves the pages, to keep query result consistent exception is thrown.

If explicit transaction is started, cache operations binded to this transaction also can throw an `ClientException` in case of failed connection to server node.

User code should handle these exceptions and implement retry logic accordingly.

== Security

=== SSL/TLS

To use encrypted communication between the thin client and the cluster, you have to enable SSL/TLS in both the cluster configuration and the client configuration. Refer to the link:thin-clients/getting-started-with-thin-clients#enabling-ssltls-for-thin-clients[Enabling SSL/TLS for Thin Clients] section for the instruction on the cluster configuration.

To enable encrypted communication in the thin client, provide a keystore that contains the encryption key and a truststore with the trusted certificates in the thin client configuration.

[source, java]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=ssl-configuration,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following table explains encryption parameters of the client configuration:

[cols="1,3,1",opts="header,stretch"]
|===
| Parameter | Description | Default Value
| sslMode | Either  `REQURED` or `DISABLED`. | `DISABLED`
| sslClientCertificateKeyStorePath | The path to the keystore file with the private key. | N/A
| sslClientCertificateKeyStoreType | The type of the keystore. | `JKS`
| sslClientCertificateKeyStorePassword | The password to the keystore.| N/A
| sslTrustCertificateKeyStorePath | The path to the truststore file.| N/A
| sslTrustCertificateKeyStoreType | The type of the truststore. | `JKS`
| sslTrustCertificateKeyStorePassword | The password to the truststore. | N/A
| sslKeyAlgorithm| Sets the key manager algorithm that is used to create a key manager. | `SunX509`
| sslTrustAll | If this parameter is set to `true`, the certificates are not validated. | N/A
| sslProtocol | The name of the protocol that is used for data encryption. | `TLS`
|===

=== Authentication

Configure link:security/authentication[authentication on the cluster side] and provide the user name and password in the client configuration.
