= .NET Thin Client

:sourceCodeFile: code-snippets/dotnet/ThinClient.cs

== Prerequisites
- Supported runtimes: .NET 4.0+, .NET Core 2.0+
- Supported OS: Windows, Linux, macOS (any OS supported by .NET Core 2.0+)

== Installation

The .NET thin client API is provided by the Ignite.NET API library, which is located in the `{IGNITE_HOME}/platforms/dotnet` directory of the Ignite distribution package.
The API is located in the `Apache.Ignite.Core` assembly.

== Connecting to Cluster

The thin client API entry point is the `Ignition.StartClient(IgniteClientConfiguration)` method.
The `IgniteClientConfiguration.Endpoints` property is mandatory; it must point to the host where the server node is running.

=== Failover

You can provide multiple node addresses. In this case thin client connects to a random node in the list, and *failover mechanism* is enabled: if a server node fails, client tries other known addresses and reconnects automatically.
Note that `IgniteClientException` can be thrown if a server node fails while client operation is being performed -
user code should handle this exception and implement retry logic accordingly.

[[discovery]]
=== Automatic Server Node Discovery

Thin client can discover server nodes in the cluster automatically.
This behavior is enabled when link:#partition_awareness[Partition Awareness] is enabled.

Server discovery is an asynchronous process - it happens in the background.
Additionally, thin client receives topology updates only when it performs some operations (to minimize server load and network traffic from idle connections).

You can observe the discovery process by enabling logging and/or calling `IIgniteClient.GetConnections`:

[source, csharp]
----
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=discovery,indent=0]
----

[WARNING]
====
[discrete]
Server discovery may not work when servers are behind a NAT server or a proxy.
Server nodes provide their addresses and ports to the client, but when the client is in a different subnet, those addresses won't work.
====

[[partition_awareness]]
== Partition Awareness

Partition awareness allows the thin client to send query requests directly to the node that owns the queried data.

[WARNING]
====
[discrete]
Partition awareness is an experimental feature whose API or design architecture might change before a GA version is released.
====

Without partition awareness, an application that is connected to the cluster via a thin client executes all queries and operations via a single server node that acts as a proxy for the incoming requests.
These operations are then re-routed to the node that stores the data that is being requested.
This results in a bottleneck that could prevent the application from scaling linearly.

image::images/partitionawareness01.png[Without Partition Awareness]

Notice how queries must pass through the proxy server node, where they are routed to the correct node.

With partition awareness in place, the thin client can directly route queries and operations to the primary nodes that own the data required for the queries.
This eliminates the bottleneck, allowing the application to scale more easily.

image::images/partitionawareness02.png[With Partition Awareness]

To enable partition awareness, set the `IgniteClientConfiguration.EnablePartitionAwareness` property to `true`.
This enables link:#discovery[server discovery] as well.
If the client is behind a NAT or a proxy, automatic server discovery may not work.
In this case provide addresses of all server nodes in the client's connection configuration.


== Using Key-Value API


=== Getting Cache Instance
The `ICacheClient` interface provides the key-value API. You can use the following methods to obtain an instance of `ICacheClient`:

- `GetCache(cacheName)` — returns an instance of an existing cache.
- `CreateCache(cacheName)` — creates a cache with the given name.
- `GetOrCreateCache(CacheClientConfiguration)` — gets or creates a cache with the given configuration.

[source, csharp]
----
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=createCache,indent=0]
----

Use `IIgniteClient.GetCacheNames()` to obtain a list of all existing caches.

=== Basic Operations
The following code snippet demonstrates how to execute basic cache operations on a specific cache.

[source, csharp]

include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=basicOperations,indent=0]

////
=== Asynchronous Execution
////


=== Working With Binary Objects
The .NET thin client supports the Binary Object API described in the link:key-value-api/binary-objects[Working with Binary Objects] section. Use `ICacheClient.WithKeepBinary()` to switch the cache to binary mode and start working directly with binary objects avoiding serialization/deserialization. Use `IIgniteClient.GetBinary()` to get an instance of `IBinary` and build an object from scratch.

[source, csharp]
----
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=binaryObj,indent=0]
----

== Scan Queries
Use a scan query to get a set of entries that satisfy a given condition.
The thin client sends the query to the cluster node where it is executed as a normal scan query.

The query condition is specified by an `ICacheEntryFilter` object that is passed to the query constructor as an argument.

Define a query filter as follows:
[source, csharp]
----
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=scanQry,indent=0]
----

Then execute the scan query:
[source, csharp]
----
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=scanQry2,indent=0]
----


== Executing SQL Statements

The thin client provides a SQL API to execute SQL statements. SQL statements are declared using `SqlFieldsQuery` objects and executed through the `ICacheClient.Query(SqlFieldsQuery)` method.
Alternatively, SQL queries can be performed via Ignite LINQ provider.

[source, csharp]

include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=executingSql,indent=0]

== Cluster API

Cluster functionality (APIs for accessing cluster and nodes) is provided via the `IClientCluster` interface.
You can get an instance of `IClientCluster` from `IIgniteClient` as follows:
[source, csharp]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=client-cluster,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Through the `IClientCluster` interface you can:

* Get or set cluster state
* Get a list of all cluster members
* Create logical groups of nodes

=== Logical nodes grouping

API to create logical groups of nodes within your cluster is provided by `IClientClusterGroup` interface.
Instance of this interface can be obtained from a parent `IClientClusterGroup` instance using node-filtering methods.

The `IClientCluster` instance implements `IClientClusterGroup` and is a root cluster group, which includes all nodes in the cluster.

Here is how you can use this API to get all server nodes in certain data-center (assuming node attribute "dc" is set to bind node and data-center):
[source, csharp]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
include::{sourceCodeFile}[tag=client-cluster-groups,indent=0]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Refer to link:distributed-computing/cluster-groups[Cluster groups] to get more information about logical nodes grouping.

*TODO: fix class names, add snippets below*

== Executing compute tasks

Thin client has basic functionality to execute compute tasks. This feature is disabled by default on the server side.
Set `ThinClientConfiguration.MaxActiveComputeTasksPerConnection` to a non-zero value to enable:

Compute functionality is provided by `IComputeClient` interface, which can be obtained from `IIgniteClient` instance.

Currently, thin clients can run already deployed tasks by class name. Task classes should be depoyed in advance to the server nodes.

== Security

=== SSL/TLS

To use encrypted communication between the thin client and the cluster, you have to enable SSL/TLS in both the cluster configuration and the client configuration. Refer to the link:thin-clients/getting-started-with-thin-clients#enabling-ssltls-for-thin-clients[Enabling SSL/TLS for Thin Clients] section for the instruction on the cluster configuration.

The following code example demonstrates how to configure SSL parameters in the thin client.

=== Authentication


Configure link:security/authentication[authentication on the cluster side] and provide a valid user name and password in the client configuration.
