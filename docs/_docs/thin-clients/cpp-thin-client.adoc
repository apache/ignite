= C++ Thin Client

== Prerequisites

* C++ compiler: MS Visual C++ (10.0 and up), g++ (4.4.0 and up)
* Visual Studio 2010 or newer


== Installation
The source code of the C++ thin client comes with the Ignite distribution package under the `{IGNITE_HOME}/platforms/cpp` directory.

# You can call the following command to see all the available
# configuration options:
# ./configure --help
# To use default configuration just type:
./configure
make

#The following step is optional if you want to install Ignite
#for your system. It would probably require root:
sudo make install

== Creating Client Instance
The API provided by the thin client is located under the `ignite::thin` namespace.
The main entry point to the API is the `IgniteClient::Start(IgniteClientConfiguration)` method, which returns an instance of the client.

== Using Key-Value API

=== Getting Cache Instance

To perform basic key-value operations on a cache, obtain an instance of the cache as follows:

[source, cpp]
----
include::code-snippets/cpp/src/thin_client_cache.cpp[tag=thin-getting-cache-instance,indent=0]
----

The `GetOrCreateCache(cacheName)` returns an instance of the cache if it exists or creates the cache.

=== Basic Cache Operations
The following code snippet demonstrates how to execute basic cache operations on a specific cache.

== Security

=== SSL/TLS

To use encrypted communication between the thin client and the cluster, you have to enable SSL/TLS both in the cluster configuration and the client configuration. Refer to the link:thin-clients/getting-started-with-thin-clients#enabling-ssltls-for-thin-clients[Enabling SSL/TLS for Thin Clients] section for instructions on the cluster configuration.

=== Authentication

Configure link:security/authentication[authentication on the cluster side] and provide a valid user name and password in the client configuration.
