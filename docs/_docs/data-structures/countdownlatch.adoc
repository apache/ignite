= CountDownLatch

:javaFile: {javaCodeDir}/DataStructures.java

`IgniteCountDownLatch` provides functionality that is similar to that of `java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch` and allows you to synchronize operations accross cluster nodes.

A distributed CountDownLatch can be created as follows:

[source, java]
----
include::{javaFile}[tags=count-down-latch, indent=0]
----


After the above code is executed, all nodes in the specified cache will be able to synchronize on the latch named `latchName`.
Below is a code example of such synchronization:


[source, java]

include::{javaFile}[tags=sync-on-latch, indent=0]
