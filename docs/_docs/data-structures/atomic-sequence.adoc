= Atomic Sequence

:javaFile: {javaCodeDir}/DataStructures.java

== Overview

Distributed atomic sequence provided by `IgniteCacheAtomicSequence`  interface is similar to distributed atomic long, but its value can only go up. It also supports reserving a range of values to avoid costly network trips or cache updates every time a sequence must provide a next value. That is, when you perform `incrementAndGet()` (or any other atomic operation) on an atomic sequence, the data structure reserves ahead a range of values, which are guaranteed to be unique across the cluster for this sequence instance.

Here is an example of how atomic sequence can be created:

== Sequence Reserve Size

The key parameter of `IgniteAtomicSequence` is `atomicSequenceReserveSize` which is the number of sequence values reserved, per node .  When a node tries to obtain an instance of `IgniteAtomicSequence`, a number of sequence values will be reserved for that node and consequent increments of sequence will happen locally without communication with other nodes, until the next reservation has to be made.

The default value for `atomicSequenceReserveSize` is `1000`. This default setting can be changed by modifying the `atomicSequenceReserveSize` property of `AtomicConfiguration`.

Refer to link:data-structures/atomic-types#atomic-configuration[Atomic Configuration] for more information on various atomic configuration properties.
