= Binary Client Protocol

Ignite binary client protocol enables user applications to communicate with an existing Ignite cluster without starting a full-fledged Ignite node.
An application can connect to the cluster through a raw TCP socket. Once the connection is established, the application can communicate with the Ignite cluster and perform cache operations using the established format.

This Alpha release implementation of binary client protocol comes with the following improvements:

* Implemented link:https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/IGNITE/IEP-75+Thin+Client+MsgPack+Serialization[MsgPack,window=_blank] as an underlying binary format;
* Added new set of data types;
* Added more flexible and extensible handshake with the magic header string.
