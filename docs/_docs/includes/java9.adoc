To run Ignite with Java 11 or later, follow these steps:

1.  Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the Java installation
directory.
2.  Ignite uses proprietary SDK APIs that are not available by
default. You need to pass specific flags to JVM to make these APIs
available. If you use the start-up script `ignite.sh` (or `ignite.bat` for Windows), you do not need
to do anything because these flags are already set up in the script.
Otherwise, provide the following parameters to the JVM of your
application:
+
[source,shell]

3.  TLSv1.3, which is available in Java 11, is not supported at the
moment. Consider adding `â€‘Djdk.tls.client.protocols=TLSv1.2` if SSL
between nodes is used.
