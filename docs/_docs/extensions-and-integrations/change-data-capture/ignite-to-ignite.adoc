= Ignite to Ignite cross-cluster replication

== Ignite to Java Thin Client CDC streamer
This streamer starts link:thin-clients/java-thin-client[Java Thin Client] which connects to destination cluster.
After connection is established, all changes captured by CDC will be replicated to destination cluster.

NOTE: Instances of `ignite-cdc.sh` with configured streamer should be started on each server node of source cluster to capture all changes.
