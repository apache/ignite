= Cluster States

:javaFile: {javaCodeDir}/ClusterAPI.java

== Overview

An Ignite cluster can be in one of the three states: `ACTIVE`, `ACTIVE_READ_ONLY`, and `INACTIVE`.

When you start a pure in-memory cluster (no persistent data regions) for the first time, the cluster is in the `ACTIVE` state.
When you start a cluster with persistent data regions for the first time, the cluster is `INACTIVE`.


* `INACTIVE`: All operations are prohibited.
+
--
When you change the cluster state from active to `INACTIVE` (deactivation), the cluster deallocates all memory resources.

--
* `ACTIVE`: This is the normal mode of the cluster. You can execute any operation.

* `ACTIVE_READ_ONLY`: The read-only mode. Only read operations are allowed.
+
--
Any attempt to create a cache or modify the data in an existing cache results in an `IgniteClusterReadOnlyException` exception.
DDL or DML statements that modify the data are prohibited as well.
