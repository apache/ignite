= System Views

WARNING: The system views are an experimental feature and can be changed in future releases.

Ignite provides a number of built-in SQL views that contain information about cluster nodes and node metrics.
The views are available in the SYS schema.
See the link:SQL/schemas[Understanding Schemas] page for the information on how to access a non-default schema.

[IMPORTANT]
====
[discrete]
=== Limitations
. You cannot create objects in the SYS schema.
. System views from the SYS schema cannot be joined with user tables.
====


== Querying System Views


To query the system views using the link:tools/sqlline[SQLLine] tool, connect to the SYS schema as follows:

[source, shell]
----
./sqlline.sh -u jdbc:ignite:thin://127.0.0.1/SYS
----

If your node is running on a remote server, replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the server.

Run a query:

[source, sql]
----
-- get the list of nodes
select * from NODES;

-- view the CPU load as a percentage for a specific node
select CUR_CPU_LOAD * 100 from NODE_METRICS where NODE_ID = 'a1b77663-b37f-4ddf-87a6-1e2d684f3bae'

----

The same example using link:thin-clients/java-thin-client[Java Thin Client]:

[source, java]
----
include::{javaCodeDir}/JavaThinClient.java[tag=system-views,indent=0]
----


System views can also be queried through the link:tools/control-script#system-view-command[Control Script system view command].
Note that the mentioned above command result contains all columns of the requested system view. If filtering is necessary, it should be performed manually.

Examples of the use of link:tools/control-script#system-view-command[Control Script system view command]:

[tabs]
--
tab:Unix[]
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
# get the list of nodes
control.sh --system-view NODES

# get the list of metrics from the node with the specific ID
control.sh --system-view NODE_METRICS --node-id a1b77663-b37f-4ddf-87a6-1e2d684f3bae
----
tab:Windows[]
[source,shell,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
# get the list of nodes
control.bat --system-view NODES

# get the list of metrics from the node with the specific ID
control.bat --system-view NODE_METRICS --node-id a1b77663-b37f-4ddf-87a6-1e2d684f3bae

== PAGE_LISTS

The page list is a data structure used to store a list of partially free data pages (free lists) and fully free allocated
pages (reuse lists). The purpose of the free lists and reuse lists is to quickly locate a page with enough free space
to save an entry or to determine that no such page exists and a new page should be allocated.
The page lists are organized in buckets. Each bucket group references pages with about the same size of a free space.

If Ignite persistence is enabled, the page lists are created for each partition of each cache group. To view such page lists
use the `CACHE_GROUP_PAGE_LISTS` system view. If Ignite persistence is disabled, the page lists are created for each data region.
In this case, the `DATA_REGION_PAGE_LISTS` system view needs to used. These views contain information about each bucket
of each page list that is useful to understand how much data can be inserted into a cache without allocating new pages
and also helps to detect skews in page lists utilization.
