=== Configuring .NET, Python, Node.JS and other programming languages

* .NET developers: refer to the link:net-specific/net-configuration-options[Ignite.NET Configuration] section
* Developers of Python, Node.JS, and other programming languages: use this page to configure your
Java-powered Ignite cluster and link:thin-clients/getting-started-with-thin-clients[thin clients] section to set up
your language-specific applications that will be working with the cluster.
====

== System Requirements

Ignite was tested on:

include::includes/prereqs.adoc[]

== Running Ignite with Java 11 or later

include::includes/java9.adoc[]


== Using Binary Distribution

* Download the appropriate binary package from https://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi[Apache Ignite Downloads^].
* Unzip the archive into a directory.
* (Optional) Set the `IGNITE_HOME` environment variable to point to the
installation folder and make sure there is no trailing `/` in the path.

== Using Maven

The easiest way to use Ignite is to add it to your pom.

[source, xml,subs="attributes,specialchars" ]
----

<properties>
    <ignite.version>{version}</ignite.version>
</properties>

<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
        <artifactId>ignite-core</artifactId>
        <version>${ignite.version}</version>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
----

The 'ignite-core' library contains the core functionality of Ignite.
Addition functionality is provided by various Ignite modules.

The following are the two most commonly used modules:


* `ignite-spring` (support for link:understanding-configuration#spring-xml-configuration[XML-based configuration])
* `ignite-indexing` (support for SQL indexing)


[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
    <artifactId>ignite-spring</artifactId>
    <version>${ignite.version}</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
    <artifactId>ignite-indexing</artifactId>
    <version>${ignite.version}</version>
</dependency>

== Using Docker

If you want to run Ignite in Docker, refer to the link:installation/installing-using-docker[Docker Deployment] section.

== Configuring Work Directory

Ignite uses a work directory to store your application data (if you use the link:persistence/native-persistence[Native Persistence] feature), index files, metadata information, logs, and other files. The default work directory is as follows:

* `$IGNITE_HOME/work`, if the `IGNITE_HOME` system property is defined. This is the case when you start Ignite using the `bin/ignite.sh` script from the distribution package.
* `./ignite/work`, this path is relative to the directory where you launch your application.

There are several ways you can change the default work directory:

. As an environmental variable:
+
[source, shell]
----
export IGNITE_WORK_DIR=/path/to/work/directory
----

. In the node configuration:
+
[tabs]
--
tab:XML[]

[source, xml]

<bean class="org.apache.ignite.configuration.IgniteConfiguration">
    <property name="workDirectory" value="/path/to/work/directory"/>
    <!-- other properties -->
</bean>

== Enabling Modules

Ignite ships with a number of modules that provide various
functionality. You can enable modules one by one, as required.

All modules are included in the binary distribution, but by default they
are disabled (except for the `ignite-core`, `ignite-spring`, and
`ignite-indexing` modules). Modules can be found in the `lib/optional`
directory of the distribution package (each module is located in a
separate sub-directory).

Depending on how you use Ignite, you can enable modules using one of
the following methods:

* If you use the binary distribution, move the
`lib/optional/{module-dir}` to the `lib` directory before starting the
node.
* Add libraries from `lib/optional/{module-dir}` to the classpath of
your application.
* Add a module as a Maven dependency to your project.
+
[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.ignite</groupId>
    <artifactId>ignite-log4j2</artifactId>
    <version>${ignite.version}</version>
</dependency>
----


The following modules have LGPL dependencies and, therefore, can't be deployed on the Maven Central repository:

* ignite-hibernate
* ignite-geospatial
* ignite-schedule

To use these modules, you will need to build them from sources and add to your project.
For example, to install `ignite-hibernate` into your local repository, run this command in the Ignite source package:


[source, shell]
----
mvn clean install -DskipTests -Plgpl -pl modules/hibernate -am
----

== Configuration Recommendations

Below are some recommended configuration tips aimed at making it easier for
you to operate an Ignite cluster or develop applications with Ignite.

=== Setting Work Directory

If you are going to use either binary distribution or Maven, you are
encouraged to set up the work directory for Ignite.
The work directory is used to store metadata information, index files, your application data (if you use the link:persistence/native-persistence[Native Persistence] feature), logs, and other files.
We recommend you always set up the work directory.


=== Recommended Logging Configuration

Logs play an important role when it comes to troubleshooting and finding what went wrong. Here are a few general tips on how to manage your log files:

* Start Ignite in verbose mode:
   - If you use `ignite.sh`, specify the `-v` option.
   - If you start Ignite from Java code, set the following system variable: `IGNITE_QUIET=false`.
* Do not store log files in the `/tmp` folder. This folder is cleared up every time the server is restarted.
* Make sure that there is enough space available on the storage where the log files are stored.
* Archive old log files periodically to save on storage space.
