= Custom SQL Functions

:javaFile: {javaCodeDir}/SqlAPI.java

The SQL Engine can extend the SQL functions' set, defined by the ANSI-99 specification, via the addition of custom SQL functions written in Java.

A custom SQL function is just a public static method marked by the `@QuerySqlFunction` annotation.

TODO looks like it's unsupported in C#

The class that owns the custom SQL function has to be registered in the `CacheConfiguration`.
To do that, use the `setSqlFunctionClasses(...)` method.

Once you have deployed a cache with the above configuration, you can call the custom function from within SQL queries:

[source,java]
----
include::{javaFile}[tags=sql-function-query, indent=0]
----


Custom SQL function can be a table function. Result of table function is treated as a row set (a table) and can be used
by other SQL operators. Custom SQL function is also a `public` method marked by annotation `@QuerySqlTableFunction`.
Table function must return an `Iterable` as a row set. Each row can be represented by an `Object[]` or by a `Collection`.
Row length must match the defined number of column types. Row value types must match the defined column types or be able
assigned to them.

NOTE: The table functions also are available currently only with link:SQL/sql-calcite[Calcite, window=_blank].

NOTE: Classes registered with `CacheConfiguration.setSqlFunctionClasses(...)` must be added to the classpath of all the nodes where the defined custom functions might be executed. Otherwise, you will get a `ClassNotFoundException` error when trying to execute the custom function.
