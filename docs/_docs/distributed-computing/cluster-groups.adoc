= Cluster Groups

:javaFile: {javaCodeDir}/ClusterAPI.java

The `ClusterGroup` interface represents a logical group of nodes, which can be used in many of Ignite's APIs when you want to limit the scope of specific operations to a subset of nodes (instead of the whole cluster). For example, you may wish to deploy a service only on remote nodes or execute a job only on the set of nodes that have a specific attribute.

TIP: Note that the `IgniteCluster` interface is also a cluster group which includes all the nodes in the cluster.

You can limit job execution, service deployment, messaging, events, and
other tasks to run only on a specific set of node. For example, here is
how to broadcast a job only to remote nodes (excluding the local node).

For convenience, Ignite comes with a number of predefined cluster groups.
