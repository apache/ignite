<!--
    This template file contains settings needed to run Apache Hadoop jobs
    with Apache Ignite's distributed in-memory file system IgniteFS.

    You can replace '$HADOOP_HOME/etc/hadoop/core-site.xml' file with this one
    to work with IgniteFS nodes running on localhost (these local nodes can be
    a part of distributed cluster though). To work with file system on remote
    hosts you need to change the host of file system URI to any host running
    IgniteFS node.

    Note that Ignite jars must be in Apache Hadoop client classpath to work
    with this configuration.

    Run script '$IGNITE_HOME/bin/setup-hadoop.{sh|bat}' for Apache Hadoop client setup.
